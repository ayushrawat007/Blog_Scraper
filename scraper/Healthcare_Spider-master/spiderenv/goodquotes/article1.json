{"blogTitle": "How to Boost Your Relationship and Sex Life with Healthy Eating", "blogText": "<h2 class=\"css-13i30ag\"><div><a name=\"overview\"> Food and sex</a></div></h2> <p>Much of the lore surrounding the desire- and performance-enhancing effects of certain foods is anecdotal. But a good diet can help boost your libido and ensure your body is working well. A poor diet can lead to a host of health issues, which may negatively effect your sex life. For example, erectile dysfunction is often linked to obesity and diabetes, which can be caused by a poor diet. </p> <p>Food is an important part of your everyday life and overall health. So it may not surprise you that your diet can affect your sex life. Changing your eating habits and behaviors may not be a cure-all for sexual issues, but it's a good place to start.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"diet-and-supplements\"> Diet and supplements</a></div></h2> <p>Eating a well-balanced diet and taking certain supplements may help improve your overall health and sex life. It's also important to avoid drinking too much alcohol.</p> <p>Fueling your body with the right kinds of food can help boost your mood and energy levels to support a healthy relationship and sex life. For optimum health, eat a nutrient-rich diet that's low in trans fats, saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. Eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean proteins. To avoid gaining weight, don't eat more calories than you burn in a day.</p> <p>Arginine, also known as L-arginine, is an amino acid used by your body to make nitric oxide. This important chemical helps your blood vessels relax, which promotes good blood flow. If you're a man, good blood flow to the erectile tissues in your penis is important for sustaining an erection. </p> <p>When you take supplemental arginine, your intestines break most of it down before it reaches your bloodstream. It may be more helpful to take L-citrulline supplements. L-citrulline is another amino acid that's converted to arginine in your body. A small study published in <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195829\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Urology</a></hl-trusted-source> found that L-citrulline supplements were more effective than a placebo for treating mild erectile dysfunction. </p> <p>Both amino acids are also found in foods. L-citrulline is found in foods such as watermelon. Arginine is found in many foods, including:</p> <p>The link between zinc and sexual health isn't completely understood, but zinc appears to affect your body's production of testosterone. It's also necessary for the development of sperm and semen in men. Adequate zinc levels may boost male fertility. Zinc and other nutrients, such as folate, may also impact female fertility. </p> <p>Zinc is available in supplement form. It's also found in some foods. Oysters are nature's richest source of this essential element. Not surprisingly, they have traditionally been viewed as aphrodisiacs, capable of kindling sexual desire. </p> <p>Drinking alcohol may lower your inhibitions and increase the likelihood that you'll engage in sexual activity. However, it can also cause acute or chronic erectile dysfunction. It can lead to unsafe behavior too. When you mix sex with alcohol, you're less likely to use proper precautions to prevent unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Out of control drinking can also negatively affect your behavior and relationships with other people. Don't rely on alcohol to improve your sex life.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"habits-and-conflicts\"> Food-related habits and conflicts</a></div></h2> <p>Sometimes, food can be a source of stress and conflict in relationships. On the other hand, you and your partner may bond over shared meals together.</p> <p>In some sense, your brain is the most important sex organ. Sex begins with affection, intimacy, and desire. Mealtime is a great time to unwind with your partner and build intimacy in a relaxed and pleasurable setting.</p> <p>Sometimes, different food preferences and habits can be a source of stress in a relationship. To help build intimacy and trust, talk to your partner about issues surrounding your relationship with food. Sources of potential conflicts include: </p> <p>If either of you have a history of eating disorders or chronic dieting, that can also influence your relationships with food and each other.</p> <p>Body weight is tied to self-esteem and body image for many people. If your partner is trying to lose weight, help them along the way. If you know they're an emotional eater, offer them support when they seem upset. Criticizing their food choices or looking over their shoulder while they're eating won't foster good feelings. Be supportive, not destructive.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"dietrelated-conditions\"> Diet-related conditions</a></div></h2> <p>Many diet-related health conditions can negatively impact your sex life, as well as your overall health and quality of life. Take steps to prevent and treat diet-related conditions, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. </p> <p>Obesity has been linked to lower fertility. Being overweight or obese may also damage your self-esteem, which can affect your libido and desire to be intimate. </p> <p>To lose excess weight, burn more calories than you consume. Eat healthy portion sizes and limit foods that are high in fat and added sugars. Getting regular exercise is also important.</p> <p>Eating too much sodium can increase your blood pressure and limit your blood flow. This can lead to erectile dysfunction in men and reduce blood flow to the vagina in women. Certain blood pressure medications can also cause undesired sexual side effects. </p> <p>To help maintain healthy blood pressure, follow a well-balanced diet, don't eat too much sodium, and include potassium-rich foods daily. If you think you're experiencing negative side effects from blood pressure medication, talk to your doctor. An alternative medication may be available. </p> <p>A diet high in saturated or trans fats can increase your bad LDL cholesterol. Too much LDL cholesterol can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries, which can limit blood flow and contribute to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of most heart disease. It can also contribute to erectile dysfunction.</p> <p>To help maintain healthy blood cholesterol levels, eat a well-balanced diet that's rich in fiber and low in saturated and trans fats. Include foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"takeaway\"> Tips for a healthy sex life</a></div></h2>", "source": ["Healthline.com"], "keyword": ["daily health fooding routine"], "link": ["https://www.healthline.com/health/food-and-sex"]},
{"blogTitle": "According to Nutritionists, These Are the 7 Ingredients Your Multivitamin Should Have", "blogText": "<p>I try to get all of my nutrients from my kitchen instead of my medicine cabinet, but as a realist, I know that meeting my nutrition needs all of the time is not possible, says Bonnie Taub-Dix, RDN, creator of <a href=\"https://bonnietaubdix.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Better Than Dieting</a>. On top of that, there may be other life factors that make supplementation necessary - pregnancy, menopause, or even chronic conditions.</p> <p>One <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=195038\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">2002 review</a> found that vitamin deficiencies are commonly linked to chronic diseases, and supplementation may help. Even a complete diet may not be giving you the nutrients you need, when you need them. That's where <a href=\"/nutrition/do-multivitamins-work\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">multivitamins</a> come in.</p> <p>For starters, a daily multivitamin can help provide a good foundation for your health. It can also protect you when you're <a href=\"/health/stress/effects-on-body\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">experiencing stress</a>, <a href=\"/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">sleeping poorly</a>, or not getting <a href=\"/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">regular exercise</a>. Even with a perfect diet, these issues can make it tough for your body to properly absorb the nutrients, explains nutritionist Dawn Lerman, MA, CHHC, LCAT, AADP.</p> <p>But with so many vitamin and mineral combos, how do we know exactly what to look for when shopping for a multivitamin? Luckily, you don't need an advanced degree in nutrition to figure out which multi is worth taking with your morning OJ. We asked four experts to tell us which seven ingredients your multivitamin should have, no matter what brand you choose.</p> <h2>1. Vitamin D</h2> <p><a href=\"/health/food-nutrition/benefits-vitamin-d\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Vitamin D</a> helps our bodies absorb calcium, which is important for bone health. Not getting enough of this vitamin can increase:</p> <p>While you technically should be able to get your daily vitamin D by being in the <a href=\"/health/depression/benefits-sunlight\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">sunlight</a> for 15 minutes, the reality is that over <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531710002599?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">40 percent</a> of people in the United States don't. Living in wintery locations with little sunlight, working an office 9 to 5 life, and <a href=\"/health/the-best-sunscreen-isnt-from-america\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">applying sunscreen</a> (which blocks vitamin D synthesis) makes getting vitamin D hard. This vitamin is also hard to come by in food, which is why Taub-Dix says to look for this ingredient in your multi.</p> <p><strong>Pro-tip: </strong>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">recommends</a> that children 1-13 years of age and adults 19-70, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, get 600 IU of vitamin D per day. Older adults should get 800 IU.</p> <h2>2. Magnesium</h2> <p><a href=\"/nutrition/10-proven-magnesium-benefits\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Magnesium</a> is an essential nutrient, which means that we must get it from food or supplements. Lerman notes that magnesium is best known for being important to our bone health and energy production. However, magnesium may have more benefits than that. She adds that this mineral can also:</p> <p>But a lot of people are <a href=\"/nutrition/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">magnesium deficient</a> because they aren't eating the <a href=\"/nutrition/10-foods-high-in-magnesium\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">right foods</a>, not because they need supplements. Try eating more pumpkin, spinach, artichoke, soybeans, beans, tofu, brown rice, or nuts (especially <a href=\"/health/food-nutrition/brazil-nut-benefits\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Brazil nuts</a>) before jumping to supplements for solutions.</p> <p><strong>Pro-tip: </strong>Lerman suggests looking for a supplement with 300-320 mg of magnesium. The <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-Consumer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">NIH agrees</a>, recommending no more than a 350-mg supplement for adults. The best forms are aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride which the body absorbs more completely.</p> <h2>3. Calcium</h2> <p><hl-trusted-source source=\"Department of Health and Human Services\" rationale=\"Governmental authority\"><a href=\"https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/06-chapter-1/d1-11.asp#figure-d1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Over 40 percent of the U.S. population</a></hl-trusted-source> doesn't get enough <a href=\"/health/8-fast-facts-about-calcium\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">calcium</a> from their diet. This means those people aren't getting the mineral they need for <a href=\"/health/build-strong-bones\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">strong bones</a> and teeth. Women in particular start losing bone density earlier, and getting enough calcium from the start is the best nutritional defense against this loss.</p> <p>If your diet is rich in these foods, you're likely getting enough calcium already.</p> <p><strong>Pro-tip: </strong>The<a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\"></a><a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">recommended amount of calcium</a> per day is 1,000 mg for most adults, and while you probably don't need to get all of your calcium needs from a multivitamin, you do want there to be some, Lerman explains. Jonathan Valdez, RDN, spokesperson for the New York State Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and owner of<a href=\"http://www.genki-nutrition.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\"></a><a href=\"https://www.genki-nutrition.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Genki Nutrition</a> recommends that you get calcium in the form of calcium citrate. This form optimizes bioavailability, causing less symptoms in people who have absorption issues.</p> <h2>4. Zinc</h2> <p>Zinc tends to be low in older people and anyone under a lot of stress, says Lerman. Which, (hello!) is basically everyone. And it makes sense. <a href=\"/health/zinc-deficiency\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Zinc</a> supports our immune system and helps our body use carbohydrates, protein, and fat for energy. It also aids in wound healing.</p> <p>The average American diet isn't rich in foods that offer zinc, and the body can't store zinc, which is why Lerman recommends your daily supplements highlight this ingredient.</p> <p><strong>Pro-tip: </strong>Lerman suggests finding a multivitamin that has 5-10 mg of zinc. The <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">NIH suggests</a> you get approximately 8-11 mg of zinc daily, so the amount you want your multivitamin to have depends on your diet.</p> <h2>5. Iron</h2> <p>Iron should be in your multivitamin, but not everyone needs the same amount of iron, Lerman advises. Some of the benefits of <a href=\"/nutrition/iron-deficiency-signs-symptoms\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">iron</a> include:</p> <p>Those who eat red meats typically get enough iron, but certain circumstances like having your menstrual cycle, going through puberty, and being pregnant may increase the amount of iron you need. This is because iron is essential during times of rapid growth and development. Vegetarians and vegans may also want to make sure their multivitamin has iron, especially if they're not supplementing meat with other <a href=\"/nutrition/11-healthy-iron-rich-foods\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">iron-rich foods</a>.</p> <p><strong>Pro-tip: </strong>Look for a multi with around 18 mg of iron in the form of ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferric citrate, or ferric sulfate, suggests Valdez. Any more than that and Valdez says you may feel nauseous.</p> <h2>6. Folate</h2> <p><a href=\"/nutrition/folic-acid-vs-folate\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Folate (or folic acid)</a> is best known for aiding in fetus development and preventing birth defects. But if you're growing out your nails, fighting depression, or looking to combat inflammation, this ingredient is important, too.</p> <p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong><a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-HealthProfessional/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\"></a> You should aim to get around <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-HealthProfessional/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">400 mcg</a> of folate, or 600 mcg if you're pregnant. When choosing a multi, look for methyl folate on the label. It's a more active form which generally indicates a more wholeful product, suggests<a href=\"http://www.isabelsmithnutrition.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\"></a><a href=\"http://www.isabelsmithnutrition.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Isabel K Smith</a>, MS, RD, CDN. Valdez adds that when you take folate with food, 85 percent of it is absorbed, but when taken on an empty stomach, you'll absorb 100 percent of it.</p> <h2>7. Vitamin B-12</h2> <p>The <a href=\"/nutrition/water-soluble-vitamins\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">B-vitamin complex</a> is like a factory made up of eight diligent workers who band together to create and sustain our body's energy supply by breaking down the micronutrients we consume (fats, proteins, carbs).</p> <p>But each has a specialized role, too. Lerman says that specifically, <a href=\"/health/b12-vitamins-for-energy\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">vitamin B-12</a> works to keep the body's nerve and blood cells healthy and helps make DNA, the genetic material in all cells. Vegan or vegetarians are prone to <a href=\"/nutrition/vitamin-b12-deficiency-symptoms\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">vitamin B-12 deficiency</a> because most food sources are animal-based like meat, poultry, fish, and eggs.</p> <p><strong>Pro-tip: </strong>The<a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/pdf/factsheets/VitaminB12-Consumer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\"></a><a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/pdf/factsheets/VitaminB12-Consumer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">recommended amount</a> of B-12 is less than 3 mcg, so Lerman recommends looking for a vitamin with 1 to 2 mcg per serving because your body gets rid of any extra B-12 when you pee. B-12 also has many forms, so Smith recommends that you look for a multi that carries B-12 as methylcobalamin (or methyl-B12), which is easiest for our bodies to absorb.</p> <h2>Don't rely on your multivitamin</h2> <p>This may be obvious, but it's worth repeating: When it comes to vitamins and minerals, get it from food first, Taub-Dix reminds us. Our bodies are designed to reap nutrients from the food we eat, and we will get all the nutrients we need, as long we're eating a varied and balanced diet.</p> <p>Because at the end of the day, supplements should be considered bonus boosters, not replacements for food. And all the experts we spoke to agree: A double-decker with a morning multi just won't cut it.</p> <p><em>Gabrielle Kassel is a </em><em>rugby-playing, mud-running, protein-smoothie-blending, meal-prepping, CrossFitting, </em><em>New York-based wellness writer.

Slow Down</a></div></h2> <p>The pace at which you eat influences how much you eat, as well as how likely you are to gain weight.</p> <p>In fact, studies comparing different eating speeds show that fast eaters are up to 115% more likely to be obese than slow eaters (<hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21802566\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">1</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18940848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">2</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26100137\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">3</a></hl-trusted-source>).</p> <p>Your appetite, how much you eat and how full you get is all controlled by hormones. These hormones signal your brain whether you're hungry or full.</p> <p>However, it takes about 20 minutes for your brain to receive these messages, so <a href=\"/nutrition/mindful-eating-guide\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">eating more slowly</a> would give your brain the time it needs to perceive that you are full.</p> <p>Studies have confirmed this, showing that eating slowly may reduce the number of calories you consume at meals and <a href=\"/nutrition/eating-slowly-and-weight-loss\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">help you lose weight</a> (<hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18589027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">4</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388483\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">5</a></hl-trusted-source>).</p> <p>Eating slowly is also linked to more thorough chewing, which has also been linked to better weight maintenance (<hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775556\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">6</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24215801\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">7</a></hl-trusted-source>).</p> <p>Therefore, simply by eating slower and chewing more often, you can reduce your risk of eating too much and gaining excess weight.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"section2\"> 2. Choose Whole-Grain Bread - Not Refined</a></div></h2> <p>You can easily make your diet a bit healthier by choosing whole grain bread in place of traditional refined-grain bread.</p> <p>As opposed to refined grains, which have been linked to many health issues, <a href=\"/nutrition/9-benefits-of-whole-grains\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">whole grains</a> have been linked to a variety of health benefits, including a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer (<hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23608304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">8</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478050\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">9</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4728653/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">10</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27301975\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">11</a></hl-trusted-source>).</p> <p>They are also a good source of fiber, B vitamins and several minerals, such as zinc, iron, magnesium and manganese.</p> <p>There are many varieties of whole-grain bread available, and many of them even taste better than refined bread.</p> <p>Just make sure to read the label to ensure that your bread is made with whole grains only, not a mixture of whole and refined grains. It's also preferable that the bread contains whole seeds or grains.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"section3\"> 3. Add Greek Yogurt to Your Diet</a></div></h2> <p><a href=\"/nutrition/greek-yogurt-benefits\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Greek yogurt</a> (or Greek-style yogurt) is thicker and creamier than regular yogurt.</p> <p>It has been strained to remove its excess whey, which is the watery part of milk. The end result is a yogurt that is higher in fat and protein than regular yogurt.</p> <p>In fact, it contains up to three times the amount of protein found in the same amount of regular yogurt, or up to 9 grams per 100 grams (<hl-trusted-source source=\"USDA Food Composition Databases\" rationale=\"Governmental authority\"><a href=\"https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">12</a></hl-trusted-source>, <a href=\"http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/104/2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">13</a>).</p> <p>Eating a good source of protein helps you feel fuller for longer, helping you manage your appetite and eat fewer calories overall (<hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23107521\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">14</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18448177\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">15</a></hl-trusted-source>).</p> <p>Furthermore, since Greek yogurt has been strained, it contains fewer carbs and lactose than regular yogurt, making it suitable for those who follow a <a href=\"/nutrition/low-carb-diet-meal-plan-and-menu\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">low-carb diet</a> or are lactose intolerant.</p> <p>Simply replace some snacks or regular yogurt varieties with Greek yogurt for a hefty dose of protein and nutrients.</p> <p>Just make sure to pick the non-flavored varieties, as flavored ones may be packed with added sugar and other unhealthy ingredients.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"section4\"> 4. Don't Shop Without a List</a></div></h2> <p>There are two important strategies to employ when you go grocery shopping: make your shopping list ahead of time and don't go to the store hungry.</p> <p>Not knowing exactly what you need makes room for impulse buying, while hunger can further exacerbate your impulses.</p> <p>To make sure you don't give in to your impulses, plan ahead and write down what you need beforehand.</p> <p>By doing this and sticking to your list, you will not only buy healthier items but also save money and have healthier foods around the house.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"section5\"> 5. Eat Eggs, Preferably for Breakfast</a></div></h2> <p>Eggs are <a href=\"/nutrition/10-proven-health-benefits-of-eggs\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">incredibly healthy</a>, especially if you eat them in the morning.</p> <p>They are rich in high-quality protein and many essential nutrients that people often don't get enough of, such as choline.</p> <p>When looking at studies comparing various types of calorie-matched breakfasts, eggs come out on top.</p> <p>Eating eggs in the morning increases feelings of fullness. This has been shown to cause people to consume fewer calories over the next 36 hours, which can be quite helpful for <a href=\"/nutrition/eggs-weight-loss-food\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">weight loss</a> (<hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16373948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">16</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20226994\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">17</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18679412\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">18</a></hl-trusted-source>).</p> <p>One study in healthy and fit young men showed that eggs caused significantly more fullness, less hunger and a lower desire to eat, compared to a breakfast consisting of cereal or croissants (<hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22948783\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">19</a></hl-trusted-source>).</p> <p>In fact, the men who had eggs for breakfast automatically ate 270\u2013470 fewer calories at lunch and dinner buffets, compared to those who ate other breakfasts.</p> <p>Therefore, simply replacing your current breakfast with eggs may result in major benefits for your health.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"section6\"> 6. Increase Your Protein Intake</a></div></h2> <p><a href=\"/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Protein</a> is often referred to as the king of nutrients, and it does seem to have some superpowers.</p> <p>Due to its ability to affect your hunger and satiety hormones, it's the most filling of the macronutrients (<hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469977\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">20</a></hl-trusted-source>, <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16002798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">21</a></hl-trusted-source>).</p> <p>One study showed that simply increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% of calories made people eat 441 fewer calories per day, without actively restricting their intake (<hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16002798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">22</a></hl-trusted-source>).</p> <p>What's more, protein helps you retain muscle mass, which determines the rate of your metabolism.

There are six main groups of essential micronutrients and macronutrients.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"protein\"> 1. Protein</a></div></h2> <p><a href=\"/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Protein</a> is having its moment, and not just in the workout community. But all of the hype is for a good reason. Protein is essential for good health.</p> <p>Protein provides the building blocks of the body, and not just for muscle. Every cell, from bone to skin to hair, contains protein.</p> <p>A startling <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/human-nutrition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">16 percent</a> of the average person's body weight is from protein. Protein is used primarily for growth, health, and body maintenance. </p> <p>All of your hormones, antibodies, and other important substances are composed of protein. Protein is not used to fuel the body unless necessary.</p> <p>Proteins are made of up different amino acids. While the body can create some amino acids on its own, there are many essential amino acids that can only come from food. You need a variety of amino acids for your body to function properly. </p> <p>The good news is that you don't need to eat all of the amino acids at once. Your body can create complete proteins from the foods you eat throughout the day.</p> <p>While meat, fish, and eggs are good sources of essential amino acids, you can also get protein from plant sources like beans, soy, nuts, and some grains. Exactly how much protein you need daily depends on a variety of factors including how active you are, and your age.</p> <p>Despite the growing popularity of high-protein diets, there haven't been enough studies to prove that they're healthier or can influence weight loss, according to the <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/high-protein-diets/faq-20058207?p=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"carbs\"> 2.\nCarbohydrates</a></div></h2> <p>Don't let the low-carb craze fool you. <a href=\"/nutrition/carbohydrate-functions\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Carbohydrates</a> are necessary for a healthy body. Carbs fuel your body, especially your central nervous system and brain, and protect against disease, according to the <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p> <p>Carbohydrates should make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories, according to the <hl-trusted-source source=\"Department of Health and Human Services\" rationale=\"Governmental authority\"><a href=\"https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a></hl-trusted-source>.</p> <p>Before you reach for the white bread or pasta, keep in mind that the type of carb you eat matters. Some carbs are healthier than others. Opt for whole grains, beans, and fiber-rich vegetables and fruits instead of refined grains and products with added sugar.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"fats\"> 3.\nFats</a></div></h2> <p><a href=\"/nutrition/how-much-fat-to-eat\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Fats</a> often get a bad rap, but recent research has shown that healthy fats are an important part of a healthy diet.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Harvard Medical School</a>, fat supports many of your body's functions such as vitamin and mineral absorption, blood clotting, building cells, and muscle movement.</p> <p>Yes, fat is high in calories, but those calories are an important energy source for your body.</p> <p>The <hl-trusted-source source=\"Department of Health and Human Services\" rationale=\"Governmental authority\"><a href=\"https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a></hl-trusted-source> recommends that 20 to 35 percent of your daily calories come from fat, but the <hl-trusted-source source=\"World Health Organization\" rationale=\"Highly respected international organization\"><a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs394/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">World Health Organization</a></hl-trusted-source> suggests keeping it under 30 percent of your calories.</p> <p>Including healthy fats in your diet can help you to balance your blood sugar, decrease your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, and improve your brain function. They're also powerful anti-inflammatories, and they may lower your risk of arthritis, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.</p> <p>The most famous unsaturated fats are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Unsaturated fats are important for your body as they provide essential fatty acids your body can't make. You can find these healthy fats in nuts, seeds, fish, and vegetable oils (like olive, avocado, and flaxseed). Coconut oil provides plant-based fats in the form of medium-chain triglycerides which impart health benefits like faster utilization by organs as fuel and appetite control.</p> <p>Avoid trans fats and limit your intake of saturated animal-based fats like butter, cheese, red meat, and ice cream.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"vitamins\"> 4.\nVitamins</a></div></h2> <p>Vitamins are vital for warding off disease and staying healthy. The body needs these micronutrients to support its functions. There are 13 essential vitamins that the body needs to function properly, including vitamins A, C, B<sub>6</sub>, and D.</p> <p>Each vitamin plays an important role in the body, and not getting enough of them can cause health problems and disease. Many Americans do not get enough of many essential vitamins. Vitamins are essential for healthy vision, skin, and bones.</p> <p>Vitamins may lower the risk of lung and prostate cancer, and they're powerful antioxidants. Vitamins like vitamin C boost the immune system and help the body heal.</p> <p>If you eat a varied, well-balanced diet full of vegetables and fruits, and have a normal and healthy functioning digestive tract, you likely don't need to take vitamin supplements.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"minerals\"> 5.\nMinerals</a></div></h2> <p>Much like vitamins, minerals help support the body. They're essential for many body functions, including building strong bones and teeth, regulating your metabolism, and staying properly hydrated. Some of the most common minerals are calcium, iron, and zinc.</p> <p>In addition to strengthening bones, calcium helps with nerve signal transmission, maintaining healthy blood pressure, and muscle contraction and relaxation. Iron supports your red blood cells and hormone creation, while zinc boosts your immune system and wound healing.</p> <h2><div><a name=\"water\"> 6.\nWater</a></div></h2> <p>You can go for weeks without food, but you can't last more than a few days without water. Water is absolutely crucial for every system in your body. It's also the main thing you are made of.

It's not surprising why, though.</p> <p>It almost like the holy grail of home remedies - for instance, a shot of it is said to help boost energy, control blood sugar, and promote weight loss. Topically, ACV may help improve your hair's shine as well as the texture and tone of your skin by clearing up unwanted breakouts.</p> <p>Mixed with other good-for-you ingredients like lemon juice or olive oil, ACV can be a potent booster for your daily routine. Here are 11 easy ways to boost your health with ACV.</p> <h2>1. Trouble with digesting roughage? Use ACV in your salad dressing</h2> <p>There are a few reasons ACV can help out with digestion issues, according to nutritionist <a href=\"https://essentialnutritionforyou.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">Rania Batayneh</a>, MPH, bestselling author of The One One One Diet.</p> <p>The first is thanks to ACV's antibacterial properties, which can lend help to common gut issues that can be caused by bacteria, like diarrhea. As a fermented food, ACV also contains probiotics that help regulate overall healthy digestion.</p> <p>Pairing an ACV-based dressing with vegetables does double duty for your digestion, as both the fiber in the veggies and the probiotics in the ACV can boost digestive health, Batayneh points out.</p> <h2>2. Looking to curb your appetite? Make a daily ACV tonic</h2> <p>Sometimes the hardest part of recalibrating eating habits is restriction. According to Batayneh, drinking ACV can be incredibly useful when trying to eat less and lose weight. She refers to a <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781306\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">study</a></hl-trusted-source> that found that ACV may suppress areas of the brain that control appetite, resulting in fewer calories eaten over time.</p> <p>ACV may also help with fat storage, thanks to a special component: acetic acid. In <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17485860\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">rat studies</a></hl-trusted-source>, this acid has been shown to help <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26176799\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">reduce</a></hl-trusted-source><hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26176799\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\"></a></hl-trusted-source><hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26176799\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">fat storage</a></hl-trusted-source>.</p> <p>After such positive results from animal studies, a <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661687\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">2009 study</a></hl-trusted-source> looked at 122 people with obesity and found that daily consumption of vinegar reduces obesity and aids weight loss.</p> <h2>3. Need natural energy? Sip an ACV-mixed tea in the AM</h2> <p>Skipping coffee? For Batayneh, a tea with ACV is a great alternative to other calorie-heavy, caffeinated drinks like lattes and sodas.</p> <p>Besides fat storage, acetic acid also boosted how muscles in mice refuel on energy resources. It's suggested to work similarly for humans.</p> <p>Lemon juice has many nutritional benefits, but specific research that links lemons to weight loss is sparse. However, drinking about <a href=\"https://health.ucsd.edu/news/2010/Pages/4-22-kidney-stones.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">four ounces of lemonade per day</a> is suggested to help with kidney stone prevention. As for cayenne pepper and cinnamon, both have ingredients that provide therapeutic benefits to help boost your metabolism and reduce inflammation.</p> <h2>4. Sore throat? Mix ACV and honey into a soothing concoction</h2> <p>With antibacterial and antiviral properties, ACV can be incredibly beneficial.</p> <p>With all that said, there isn't much scientific evidence backing the claim that <a href=\"/health/apple-cider-vinegar-for-a-sore-throat\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">honey and ACV tea</a> will completely get rid of a sore throat. The theory is that the ACV works to fight the bacteria while the honey can help suppress coughs by coating and soothing the throat.</p> <p>If your <a href=\"/health/sore-throat\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">sore throat</a> continues for days, you should see a doctor. They can prescribe antibiotics if it's a bacterial infection.</p> <h2>5. Managing insulin levels? Drink ACV with water and a meal or snack</h2> <p>For people with diabetes, incorporating ACV may be a helpful step in managing the condition. It's thought that\u2026 acetic acid may slow down the conversion of complex carbohydrates into sugar in the bloodstream, Batayneh explains. This provides more time for sugar to be removed from the bloodstream, allowing the body to keep blood sugar levels constant and limit spikes.</p> <p>There's not too much research to completely back this up, however <a href=\"http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/11/2814.long\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">one 2007 study</a> with 11 participants found that people with type 2 diabetes who took 2 tablespoons of ACV with a bedtime cheese snack woke up with much lower blood sugar levels.</p> <h2>6. Worried about cholesterol? Try this ACV egg salad recipe </h2> <p>Apples and vinegar work together in the form of ACV and naturally lend themselves to lowering triglyceride and cholesterol level, explains Batayneh. A <a href=\"http://www.lifesciencesite.com/lsj/life0904/360_10755life0904_2431_2440.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">2012 study</a> found that ACV may be able to reduce bad cholesterol along with triglyceride in people with high cholesterol levels.</p> <p>The main reason being is that the acetic acid in apple-cider vinegar is what makes it effective in lowering low-density-level (LDL) cholesterol. </p> <p>Although evidence supporting these claims are mostly anecdotal, combining ACV with other heart-healthy options can only help! Getting your cholesterol and triglyceride under control is one natural way to lower risk of heart disease.</p> <p>Just this year, <a href=\"https://heart.bmj.com/content/early/2018/04/17/heartjnl-2017-312651\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">a study</a> found that a moderate consumption of eggs can actually lower risk for cardiovascular disease. Plus, <a href=\"/nutrition/12-proven-benefits-of-avocado\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">avocados</a> are also known to contain healthy fats that can help reduce risk for heart disease.</p> <h2>7. Preventive help? Combine ACV with other anticancer foods</h2> <p>There's a theory that ACV can help make your blood alkaline, which <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8605731\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">can keep cancer cells from growing</a></hl-trusted-source>. However, it's not a full shield against cancer since your body is typically able to maintain a pretty balanced pH.</p> <p>It's <a href=\"/health/apple-cider-vinegar-cancer#benefits\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">important not to treat ACV as your only course of treatment</a>. Instead, rely on it for its other benefits, such as energy. The few studies showing that different types of vinegar can kill cancer cells are mostly animal studies.</p> <h2>8. Have a headache? Make a compress out of ACV</h2> <p>Similar to the sore throat benefit, ACV's ability to reduce headaches is mostly anecdotal. While this trick may not work for everyone, you may <a href=\"/health/apple-cider-vinegar-for-headache#headache-remedies\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">benefit from ACV</a> if you get headaches from:</p> <p>Not only will ingesting ACV help, but making a cold compress could also relieve headaches.</p> <h2>9. Boost hair shine with an ACV hair rinse</h2> <p>One of the most highly marketed beauty benefits of ACV is the <a href=\"/health/apple-cider-vinegar-hair\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">ability to increase hair shine</a>. ACV can be used as a hair rinse to boost shine by temporarily flattening the cuticle, says Batayneh. The acetic pH can close up the hair cuticle which in turn prevents frizzing and promotes shiny smoothness.</p> <p><strong>Use sparingly: </strong>Batayneh points out that you shouldn't use ACV as a rinse more than three times a week or it might start to dry out your hair. Since the pH of ACV is so different, it could turn your hair brittle and make it look dull.</p> <h2>10. Remove dandruff by making an ACV spray</h2> <p>If your <a href=\"/health/skin-disorders/dandruff-vs-dry-scalp\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">dandruff is a result of a yeast infection</a>, ACV may be an affordable home remedy as it has antifungal properties. The acid in ACV can make it difficult for fungus to grow and spread.</p> <p><strong>Don't try this if your dandruff is caused by a dry scalp</strong>. An ACV wash may further dry out your scalp and make dandruff worse.</p> <h2>11. Make an acne potion with ACV</h2> <p>As previously mentioned, ACV has antibacterial benefits thanks to its acetic acid. In addition, it also has small amounts of citric, lactic, and succinic acid. These antibacterial acids <hl-trusted-source source=\"PubMed Central\" rationale=\"Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940755\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">have been shown</a></hl-trusted-source> to kill <em>P. acnes</em>, the bacteria that causes breakouts.</p> <p>On top of the bacteria-killing acids, Batayneh points out that some claim ACV's astringent properties may help fight acne. However, she cautions, this hasn't been scientifically proven.</p> <p>While ACV contains all the right properties, there hasn't been direct research on this ingredient as a topical treatment. Even though <a href=\"/health/beauty-skin-care/face-acids-types-anti-aging\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">acids can be a good thing</a>, too much can irritate your skin, and may cause chemical burns on some people. See a dermatologist before you try any home remedy - some may be more harmful than helpful.</p> <p>If you're looking to try an all-natural treatment like ACV, remember to dilute the ingredient before applying directly onto your skin.</p> <h2>4 things to never do with ACV</h2> <p>No matter how you add ACV to your diet, make sure you never ever drink it straight. Doing so will most likely cause damage.</p> <p>It's so acidic, it may actually cause damage to your tooth enamel, esophagus, or stomach lining, especially with chronic use, warns Batayneh. Always, always dilute it. The safest method if you're drinking it, according to Batayneh, is mixing 10 parts water or tea to every one part ACV.</p> <p>When introducing ACV to your daily ingestion intake, you want to start off slow and steady. See how your body reacts to it, says Batayneh. And if you tolerate it well, you can eventually work up to one tablespoon.</p> <p>She says to scale back if you experience an upset stomach or a burning sensation. If you're nervous or unsure, see a doctor before introducing it to your routine at all.</p> <p>If you're using ACV topically, there are a few things to know. First, you should never put it directly on your skin. It's a potent ingredient so you should always dilute it with some water when using it as a toner or rinse.</p> <p>People with sensitive skin should be wary of ACV. The acetic acid and astringent properties alone can irritate your skin.</p> <p>However, a no-no for <em>all </em>skin types is to mix it with other harsh topical ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. You're highly likely to experience a bad, irritating reaction if you do.</p> <h2>In praise of ACV</h2> <p>It's safest to think of ACV like a little booster instead of a go-to miracle. In small doses, it can be incredibly beneficial and delicious. In large amounts, it could be dangerous and harmful to your health. It may even irritate your skin or <a href=\"/health/enamel-erosion\" class=\"content-link css-5r4717\">erode your tooth enamel</a>.</p> <p>But with so many benefits, it's no surprise many people turn to ACV for their ailments, but it's also equally important to keep the facts first.</p> <p>If you're interested in upping your intake beyond the recommended serving of two tablespoons, talk to professional before going full speed ahead. After all, there's a reason ACV is known to be a holy grail ingredient - you only need a little bit to feel the effects.</p> <p><em>Emily Rekstis is a New York City-based beauty and lifestyle writer who writes for many publications, including Greatist, Racked, and Self.

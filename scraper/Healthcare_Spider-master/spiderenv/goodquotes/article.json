{"blogTitle": "How to Boost Your Relationship and Sex Life with Healthy Eating", "blogText": "Much of the lore surrounding the desire- and performance-enhancing effects of certain foods is anecdotal. But a good diet can help boost your libido and ensure your body is working well. A poor diet can lead to a host of health issues, which may negatively effect your sex life. For example, erectile dysfunction is often linked to obesity and diabetes, which can be caused by a poor diet. Food is an important part of your everyday life and overall health. So it may not surprise you that your diet can affect your sex life. Changing your eating habits and behaviors may not be a cure-all for sexual issues, but it's a good place to start. Eating a well-balanced diet and taking certain supplements may help improve your overall health and sex life. It's also important to avoid drinking too much alcohol. Fueling your body with the right kinds of food can help boost your mood and energy levels to support a healthy relationship and sex life. For optimum health, eat a nutrient-rich diet that's low in trans fats, saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. Eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean proteins. To avoid gaining weight, don't eat more calories than you burn in a day. Arginine, also known as L-arginine, is an amino acid used by your body to make nitric oxide. This important chemical helps your blood vessels relax, which promotes good blood flow. If you're a man, good blood flow to the erectile tissues in your penis is important for sustaining an erection. When you take supplemental arginine, your intestines break most of it down before it reaches your bloodstream. It may be more helpful to take L-citrulline supplements. L-citrulline is another amino acid that's converted to arginine in your body. A small study published in found that L-citrulline supplements were more effective than a placebo for treating mild erectile dysfunction. Both amino acids are also found in foods. L-citrulline is found in foods such as watermelon. Arginine is found in many foods, including: The link between zinc and sexual health isn't completely understood, but zinc appears to affect your body's production of testosterone. It's also necessary for the development of sperm and semen in men. Adequate zinc levels may boost male fertility. Zinc and other nutrients, such as folate, may also impact female fertility. Zinc is available in supplement form. It's also found in some foods. Oysters are nature's richest source of this essential element. Not surprisingly, they have traditionally been viewed as aphrodisiacs, capable of kindling sexual desire. Drinking alcohol may lower your inhibitions and increase the likelihood that you'll engage in sexual activity. However, it can also cause acute or chronic erectile dysfunction. It can lead to unsafe behavior too. When you mix sex with alcohol, you're less likely to use proper precautions to prevent unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Out of control drinking can also negatively affect your behavior and relationships with other people. Don't rely on alcohol to improve your sex life. Sometimes, food can be a source of stress and conflict in relationships. On the other hand, you and your partner may bond over shared meals together. In some sense, your brain is the most important sex organ. Sex begins with affection, intimacy, and desire. Mealtime is a great time to unwind with your partner and build intimacy in a relaxed and pleasurable setting. Sometimes, different food preferences and habits can be a source of stress in a relationship. To help build intimacy and trust, talk to your partner about issues surrounding your relationship with food. Sources of potential conflicts include: If either of you have a history of eating disorders or chronic dieting, that can also influence your relationships with food and each other. Body weight is tied to self-esteem and body image for many people. If your partner is trying to lose weight, help them along the way.

Certain blood pressure medications can also cause undesired sexual side effects. To help maintain healthy blood pressure, follow a well-balanced diet, don't eat too much sodium, and include potassium-rich foods daily. If you think you're experiencing negative side effects from blood pressure medication, talk to your doctor. An alternative medication may be available. A diet high in saturated or trans fats can increase your bad LDL cholesterol. Too much LDL cholesterol can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries, which can limit blood flow and contribute to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of most heart disease. It can also contribute to erectile dysfunction. To help maintain healthy blood cholesterol levels, eat a well-balanced diet that's rich in fiber and low in saturated and trans fats.

However, making major changes to your diet can sometimes seem very overwhelming. Instead of making big changes, it may be better to start with a few smaller ones. This article discusses 25 small changes that can make a regular diet a little bit healthier. The pace at which you eat influences how much you eat, as well as how likely you are to gain weight. In fact, studies comparing different eating speeds show that fast eaters are up to 115% more likely to be obese than slow eaters ( , , ). Your appetite, how much you eat and how full you get is all controlled by hormones. These hormones signal your brain whether you're hungry or full. However, it takes about 20 minutes for your brain to receive these messages, so would give your brain the time it needs to perceive that you are full. Studies have confirmed this, showing that eating slowly may reduce the number of calories you consume at meals and ( , ). Eating slowly is also linked to more thorough chewing, which has also been linked to better weight maintenance ( , ). Therefore, simply by eating slower and chewing more often, you can reduce your risk of eating too much and gaining excess weight. You can easily make your diet a bit healthier by choosing whole grain bread in place of traditional refined-grain bread. As opposed to refined grains, which have been linked to many health issues, have been linked to a variety of health benefits, including a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer ( , , , ). They are also a good source of fiber, B vitamins and several minerals, such as zinc, iron, magnesium and manganese. There are many varieties of whole-grain bread available, and many of them even taste better than refined bread. Just make sure to read the label to ensure that your bread is made with whole grains only, not a mixture of whole and refined grains. It's also preferable that the bread contains whole seeds or grains. (or Greek-style yogurt) is thicker and creamier than regular yogurt. It has been strained to remove its excess whey, which is the watery part of milk. The end result is a yogurt that is higher in fat and protein than regular yogurt. In fact, it contains up to three times the amount of protein found in the same amount of regular yogurt, or up to 9 grams per 100 grams ( , ). Eating a good source of protein helps you feel fuller for longer, helping you manage your appetite and eat fewer calories overall ( , ). Furthermore, since Greek yogurt has been strained, it contains fewer carbs and lactose than regular yogurt, making it suitable for those who follow a or are lactose intolerant. Simply replace some snacks or regular yogurt varieties with Greek yogurt for a hefty dose of protein and nutrients. Just make sure to pick the non-flavored varieties, as flavored ones may be packed with added sugar and other unhealthy ingredients. There are two important strategies to employ when you go grocery shopping: make your shopping list ahead of time and don't go to the store hungry. Not knowing exactly what you need makes room for impulse buying, while hunger can further exacerbate your impulses. To make sure you don't give in to your impulses, plan ahead and write down what you need beforehand. By doing this and sticking to your list, you will not only buy healthier items but also save money and have healthier foods around the house. Eggs are , especially if you eat them in the morning. They are rich in high-quality protein and many essential nutrients that people often don't get enough of, such as choline. When looking at studies comparing various types of calorie-matched breakfasts, eggs come out on top. Eating eggs in the morning increases feelings of fullness. This has been shown to cause people to consume fewer calories over the next 36 hours, which can be quite helpful for ( , , ). One study in healthy and fit young men showed that eggs caused significantly more fullness, less hunger and a lower desire to eat, compared to a breakfast consisting of cereal or croissants ( ). In fact, the men who had eggs for breakfast automatically ate 270\u2013470 fewer calories at lunch and dinner buffets, compared to those who ate other breakfasts. Therefore, simply replacing your current breakfast with eggs may result in major benefits for your health. is often referred to as the king of nutrients, and it does seem to have some superpowers. Due to its ability to affect your hunger and satiety hormones, it's the most filling of the macronutrients ( , ). One study showed that simply increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% of calories made people eat 441 fewer calories per day, without actively restricting their intake ( ). What's more, protein helps you retain muscle mass, which determines the rate of your metabolism. A high protein intake may increase the number of calories you burn by 80\u2013100 per day ( , ). This is especially important for preventing the loss of muscle mass that can occur during weight loss and as you age ( , ). Aim to add a source of protein to each meal and snack. It will help you feel fuller for longer, curb cravings and make you less likely to overeat. include dairy products, nuts, peanut butter, eggs, beans and lean meat. Drinking is important for your health. Many studies have shown that drinking water may benefit , weight maintenance and even slightly increase the number of calories you burn daily ( , , ). Studies also show that drinking water before meals can reduce appetite and calorie intake during the subsequent meal in middle-aged and older adults ( , ). That said, the most important thing is to drink water of other beverages. This may drastically reduce your sugar and calorie intake ( , , ). People who drink mostly water have been shown to consume 200 fewer calories per day, on average, than those who drink other beverages ( , ). The can drastically change its effects on your health. Grilling, broiling, frying and deep-frying are all popular methods of preparing meat and fish. However, during these types of cooking methods, several potentially toxic compounds are formed, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs) ( ). All of these compounds have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and heart disease ( , , , ). Healthier cooking methods include baking, broiling, simmering, slow-cooking, poaching, pressure cooking, stewing and sous-vide. These methods do not promote the formation of these harmful compounds and thus make your food healthier ( , , , ). Nevertheless, there is nothing to say you can't enjoy the occasional grill or deep-fry, but try to use those methods sparingly. A surprising number of people around the world are , including 42% of the US population ( , ). Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is very important for bone health and the proper function of your immune system. In fact, every cell in your body has a receptor for vitamin D, indicating its importance ( , , ). Vitamin D is found in very few foods, but fatty seafood generally contains the highest amounts. are another commonly lacking nutrient found in fatty seafood. They have many important roles in the body, including reducing inflammation, maintaining heart health and promoting brain function ( , , , ). The Western diet is generally very high in omega-6 fatty acids, which promote inflammation and have been linked to many chronic diseases ( ). Omega-3s help fight this inflammation and keep the body in a more balanced state ( ). If you don't eat fatty seafood regularly, you should consider taking a . Omega-3s and vitamin D can often be found together in a supplement. Eating out does not have to involve unhealthy foods. Consider upgrading your favorite fast food restaurant to one with healthier options. There are many and fusion kitchens offering delicious and healthy meals. They may just be a great replacement for your favorite burger or pizza joint. What's more, you can generally get these meals at a very decent price. Deciding what to have for dinner can be a constant cause of frustration, which is why many people tend to use the same recipes again and again. Chances are you've been cooking the same recipes on autopilot for years. Whether these are healthy or unhealthy recipes, it's always healthy to try something new. Aim to try making a new healthy recipe at least once per week. This can change up your food and nutrient intakes and hopefully add new and healthy recipes to your routine. Alternatively, try to make a healthier version of a favorite recipe. are very filling and a common side to many dishes ( ). That said, the method in which they're prepared largely determines their health effects. For starters, 100 grams of baked potatoes contain 94 calories, while the same amount of french fries contains over three times as many, or 319 calories ( , ). Furthermore, deep-fried french fries generally contain harmful compounds, such as aldehydes and ( , ). Replacing your french fries with baked or boiled potatoes is a great way to shave off calories and avoid these harmful compounds. A good way to ensure that you eat your greens is to eat them as a starter. By doing so, you will most likely finish all of your greens while you are the hungriest and be apt to eat less of other, perhaps less healthy, components of the meal. This may lead you to eat fewer and healthier calories overall, which may result in weight loss. Furthermore, eating vegetables before a carb-rich meal has been shown to have beneficial effects on blood sugar levels. It slows down the speed at which carbs are absorbed into the bloodstream and may benefit both short- and long-term blood sugar control in people with diabetes ( , ). are very healthy. They are loaded with water, fiber, vitamins and antioxidants. Studies have repeatedly linked eating fruit to a reduced risk of several diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer ( , ). Because fruits contain fiber and various plant compounds, their sugars are generally digested very slowly and do not cause major spikes in blood sugar levels. However, the same does not apply for . Many fruit juices aren't even made from real fruit, but rather concentrate and sugar. They may even contain as much sugar as a sugary soft drink ( , ). Even real fruit juices lack the fiber and chewing resistance provided by whole fruits. This makes fruit juice much more likely to spike your blood sugar levels. It also makes it way too easy to consume too much in one sitting ( ). Try to make a habit of cooking at home most nights, rather than eating out. For one, it's easier on your budget. Second, by cooking your food yourself, you'll know exactly what is in it. You won't have to wonder about any hidden unhealthy or high-calorie ingredients. Also, by cooking large servings, you will also have leftovers for the next day, ensuring a healthy meal then, too. Finally, cooking at home has been shown to reduce the risk of excessive weight gain, especially among children ( , ). Good nutrition and exercise often go hand in hand. has been shown to improve your mood, as well as decrease feelings of depression, anxiety and stress ( , , ). These are the exact feelings that are most likely to contribute to emotional and binge eating ( , , ). Aside from strengthening your muscles and bones, exercise may help you , increase your energy levels, reduce your risk of chronic diseases and improve your sleep ( , , ). Aim to do about 30 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise each day, or simply take the stairs and go on short walks whenever possible. Sugary beverages might possibly be the unhealthiest thing you can drink. They are loaded with liquid sugar, which has been linked to numerous diseases, including heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes ( , ). Also, your brain doesn't register liquid calories the same way it registers solid calories. This means you don't compensate for the calories you drink by eating any less ( , ). One 17-ounce (500-ml) may contain about 210 calories. Try replacing your sugary beverage with either a sugar-free alternative or simply choose still or sparkling water. Doing so will shave off the extra calories and reduce your excess sugar and calorie intakes. So-called diet foods can be very deceiving. They\u2018ve usually had their fat content reduced dramatically and are often labeled fat-free, low-fat, fat-reduced or low-calorie. However, to compensate for the lost flavor and texture that the fat provided, sugar and other ingredients are often added. Therefore, many diet foods end up containing more sugar and sometimes even more calories than their full-fat counterparts ( ). Instead, opt for like fruits and vegetables. The cannot be overstated. Sleep deprivation disrupts appetite regulation, often leading to increased appetite, which results in increased calorie intake and weight gain ( , , ). In fact, people who sleep too little tend to weigh significantly more than those who get enough sleep ( , ). Being sleep deprived also negatively affects concentration, productivity, athletic performance, glucose metabolism and immune function ( , , , ). What's more, it increases your risk of several diseases, including inflammatory diseases and heart disease ( ). Therefore, it is important to try to get of good-quality sleep, preferably in one bout. Berries are and packed with nutrients, fiber and antioxidants. Most varieties can be purchased fresh, frozen or dried. Although all types are relatively healthy, the dried varieties are a much more concentrated source of calories and sugar, since all the water has been removed. A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of fresh or frozen berries contains 32\u201335 calories, while 3.5 ounces of dried strawberries contain a whopping 396 calories ( , ). The dried varieties are also often covered with sugar, further increasing the sugar content. By opting for the fresh varieties, you will get a much juicier snack that's lower in sugar and a lot lower in calories. It may be surprising that is a whole grain that's loaded with nutrients and fiber. A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of air-popped popcorn contains 387 calories and 15 grams of fiber, while the same amount of chips contains 547 calories and only 4 grams of fiber ( ). Diets rich in whole grains have been linked to health benefits, such as a reduced risk of inflammation and heart disease ( , ). For healthy popcorn, try making your own popcorn at home (not microwave popcorn varieties) or purchase air-popped popcorn. Many commercial varieties prepare their popcorn with fat, sugar and salt, making it no healthier than potato chips. Unfortunately, highly processed seed and vegetable oils have become a household staple over the past few decades. Examples include soybean, cottonseed, sunflower and canola oils. These oils are highly processed and high in omega-6 fatty acids, but deficient in omega-3s. A high can lead to inflammation and has been linked to chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis and autoimmune diseases ( , ). Swap these unhealthy oils for healthier alternatives, such as , avocado oil or . It has been proven that the size of your dinnerware can affect how much you eat. Eating from a large plate can make your portion look smaller, while eating from a small plate can make it look bigger ( ). Studies have supported this and shown that people tend to eat as much as 30% more when their food is served in a large bowl or on a large plate ( , ). Also, if you don't realize that you're eating more than usual, you will not compensate by eating less at the next meal ( , ). By eating from smaller dinnerware, you can trick your brain into thinking that you're eating more, making yourself less likely to overeat. Simply getting to the point of being able to order a salad at a restaurant is a great achievement for some people. However, your efforts should not end there. Some salads are smothered in high-calorie dressings, which may make the salads even higher in calories than other items on the menu ( ). Asking for the dressing on the side makes it a lot easier to control the portion size and therefore the calories that you consume. Coffee, which is one of the most popular beverages in the world, is very healthy. In fact, it is a major source of antioxidants and has been linked to , such as a lower risk of diabetes, mental decline and liver disease ( , , ). However, many commercial varieties of coffee contain lots of additional ingredients, such as sugar, syrup, heavy cream, sweeteners and milk. Many of these drinks are practically desserts in a cup. Drinking these varieties quickly negates all of coffee's health benefits and instead adds lots of unwanted calories and sugar. Instead, try drinking your coffee black or just adding a small amount of milk or cream and avoid sweetening it. Completely overhauling your diet all at once can be a recipe for disaster. Instead, try to incorporate some of the small changes in this article to make your diet healthier. Some of these tips will help you keep your portion sizes reasonable, while others will help you add nutrients or adapt to something new.

{"blogTitle": "According to Nutritionists, These Are the 7 Ingredients Your Multivitamin Should Have", "blogText": "I try to get all of my nutrients from my kitchen instead of my medicine cabinet, but as a realist, I know that meeting my nutrition needs all of the time is not possible, says Bonnie Taub-Dix, RDN, creator of . On top of that, there may be other life factors that make supplementation necessary - pregnancy, menopause, or even chronic conditions. One found that vitamin deficiencies are commonly linked to chronic diseases, and supplementation may help. Even a complete diet may not be giving you the nutrients you need, when you need them. That's where come in. For starters, a daily multivitamin can help provide a good foundation for your health. It can also protect you when you're , , or not getting . Even with a perfect diet, these issues can make it tough for your body to properly absorb the nutrients, explains nutritionist Dawn Lerman, MA, CHHC, LCAT, AADP. But with so many vitamin and mineral combos, how do we know exactly what to look for when shopping for a multivitamin? Luckily, you don't need an advanced degree in nutrition to figure out which multi is worth taking with your morning OJ. We asked four experts to tell us which seven ingredients your multivitamin should have, no matter what brand you choose. 1. Vitamin D helps our bodies absorb calcium, which is important for bone health. Not getting enough of this vitamin can increase: While you technically should be able to get your daily vitamin D by being in the for 15 minutes, the reality is that over of people in the United States don't. Living in wintery locations with little sunlight, working an office 9 to 5 life, and (which blocks vitamin D synthesis) makes getting vitamin D hard. This vitamin is also hard to come by in food, which is why Taub-Dix says to look for this ingredient in your multi. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) that children 1-13 years of age and adults 19-70, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, get 600 IU of vitamin D per day. Older adults should get 800 IU. 2. Magnesium is an essential nutrient, which means that we must get it from food or supplements. Lerman notes that magnesium is best known for being important to our bone health and energy production. However, magnesium may have more benefits than that. She adds that this mineral can also: But a lot of people are because they aren't eating the , not because they need supplements. Try eating more pumpkin, spinach, artichoke, soybeans, beans, tofu, brown rice, or nuts (especially ) before jumping to supplements for solutions. Lerman suggests looking for a supplement with 300-320 mg of magnesium. The , recommending no more than a 350-mg supplement for adults. The best forms are aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride which the body absorbs more completely. 3. Calcium doesn't get enough from their diet. This means those people aren't getting the mineral they need for and teeth. Women in particular start losing bone density earlier, and getting enough calcium from the start is the best nutritional defense against this loss. If your diet is rich in these foods, you're likely getting enough calcium already. The per day is 1,000 mg for most adults, and while you probably don't need to get all of your calcium needs from a multivitamin, you do want there to be some, Lerman explains. Jonathan Valdez, RDN, spokesperson for the New York State Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and owner of recommends that you get calcium in the form of calcium citrate. This form optimizes bioavailability, causing less symptoms in people who have absorption issues. 4. Zinc Zinc tends to be low in older people and anyone under a lot of stress, says Lerman. Which, (hello!) is basically everyone. And it makes sense. supports our immune system and helps our body use carbohydrates, protein, and fat for energy. It also aids in wound healing. The average American diet isn't rich in foods that offer zinc, and the body can't store zinc, which is why Lerman recommends your daily supplements highlight this ingredient. Lerman suggests finding a multivitamin that has 5-10 mg of zinc. The you get approximately 8-11 mg of zinc daily, so the amount you want your multivitamin to have depends on your diet. 5. Iron Iron should be in your multivitamin, but not everyone needs the same amount of iron, Lerman advises. Some of the benefits of include: Those who eat red meats typically get enough iron, but certain circumstances like having your menstrual cycle, going through puberty, and being pregnant may increase the amount of iron you need. This is because iron is essential during times of rapid growth and development. Vegetarians and vegans may also want to make sure their multivitamin has iron, especially if they're not supplementing meat with other . Look for a multi with around 18 mg of iron in the form of ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferric citrate, or ferric sulfate, suggests Valdez. Any more than that and Valdez says you may feel nauseous. 6. Folate is best known for aiding in fetus development and preventing birth defects. But if you're growing out your nails, fighting depression, or looking to combat inflammation, this ingredient is important, too. You should aim to get around of folate, or 600 mcg if you're pregnant. When choosing a multi, look for methyl folate on the label. It's a more active form which generally indicates a more wholeful product, suggests , MS, RD, CDN. Valdez adds that when you take folate with food, 85 percent of it is absorbed, but when taken on an empty stomach, you'll absorb 100 percent of it. 7. Vitamin B-12 The is like a factory made up of eight diligent workers who band together to create and sustain our body's energy supply by breaking down the micronutrients we consume (fats, proteins, carbs). But each has a specialized role, too. Lerman says that specifically, works to keep the body's nerve and blood cells healthy and helps make DNA, the genetic material in all cells. Vegan or vegetarians are prone to because most food sources are animal-based like meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. The of B-12 is less than 3 mcg, so Lerman recommends looking for a vitamin with 1 to 2 mcg per serving because your body gets rid of any extra B-12 when you pee. B-12 also has many forms, so Smith recommends that you look for a multi that carries B-12 as methylcobalamin (or methyl-B12), which is easiest for our bodies to absorb. Don't rely on your multivitamin This may be obvious, but it's worth repeating: When it comes to vitamins and minerals, get it from food first, Taub-Dix reminds us. Our bodies are designed to reap nutrients from the food we eat, and we will get all the nutrients we need, as long we're eating a varied and balanced diet.

{"blogTitle": "Healthy Eating - A Detailed Guide for Beginners", "blogText": "The foods you eat have big effects on your health and quality of life. Although eating healthy can be fairly simple, the rise in popular \"diets\" and dieting trends has caused confusion. In fact, these trends often distract from the basic nutrition principles that are most important. This is a detailed beginner's guide to healthy eating, based on the latest in nutrition science. Research continues to link serious diseases to a poor diet ( , ). For example, eating healthy can drastically reduce your chances of developing heart disease and cancer, the world's leading killers ( , , ). A good diet can improve all aspects of life, from brain function to physical performance. In fact, food affects all your cells and organs ( , , , ).

These nutrients are needed in relatively large amounts. They provide calories and have various functions in your body. Here are some common foods within each macronutrient group: How much of each macronutrient you should consume depends on your lifestyle and goals, as well as your personal preferences. Micronutrients are important vitamins and minerals that you require in smaller doses. Some of the most common micronutrients you should know include: All of the vitamins and minerals are \"essential\" nutrients, meaning that you must get them from the diet in order to survive. The daily requirement of each micronutrient varies between individuals. If you eat a real food-based diet that includes plants and animals, then you should get all the micronutrients your body needs without taking a supplement. You should aim to consume whole foods at least 80-90% of the time. The term \"whole foods\" generally describes natural, unprocessed foods containing only one ingredient. If the product looks like it was made in a factory, then it's probably not a whole food. Whole foods tend to be nutrient-dense and have a lower energy density. This means that they have fewer calories and more nutrients per serving than processed foods. In contrast, many processed foods have little nutritional value and are often referred to as \"empty\" calories. Eating them in large amounts is linked to obesity and other diseases. Try to base your diet around these healthy food groups: For a longer list, here is an article with . By following the advice in this article, you will naturally reduce your intake of unhealthy foods. No food needs to be eliminated forever, but some foods should be limited or saved for special occasions. These include: Your calorie intake is a key factor in weight control and health. By controlling your portions, you are more likely to avoid consuming too many calories. While whole foods are certainly a lot harder to overeat than processed foods, they can still be eaten in excess. If you are overweight or trying to lose body fat, it's particularly important to monitor your portion size. There are many simple strategies to control portion size. For example, you can use smaller plates and take a smaller-than-average first serving, then wait 20 minutes before you return for more. Another popular approach is measuring portion size with your hand. An example meal would limit most people to 1 fist-sized portion of carbs, 1\u20132 palms of protein and 1\u20132 thumb-sized portions of healthy fats. More calorie-dense foods such as cheese, nuts and fatty meats are healthy, but make sure you pay attention to portion sizes when you eat them. First, assess your calorie needs based on factors like your activity levels and weight goals. Quite simply, if you want to lose weight, you must eat less than you burn. If you want to gain weight, you should consume more calories than you burn. Here is a that tells you how much you should eat, and here are that help you track calories and nutrients. If you dislike calorie counting, you can simply apply the rules discussed above, such as monitoring portion size and focusing on whole foods. If you have a certain deficiency or are at risk of developing one, you may wish to tailor your diet to account for this. For instance, vegetarians or people who eliminate certain food groups are at greater risk of missing out on some nutrients. In general, you should consume foods of various types and colors to ensure you get plenty of all the macro- and micronutrients. While many debate whether low-carb or low-fat diets are best, the truth is that it depends on the individual. Based on research, athletes and those looking to lose weight should consider increasing their protein intake. In addition, a lower-carb diet may work wonders for some individuals trying to lose weight or treat type 2 diabetes ( , ). Here's a great rule to live by: If you can't see yourself on this diet in one, two or three years, then it's not right for you. Far too often, people go on extreme diets they can't maintain, which means they never actually develop long-term, healthy eating habits. There are some frightening weight gain statistics showing that most people regain all the weight they lost soon after attempting a weight loss diet ( ). As always, balance is key. Unless you have a specific disease or dietary requirement, no food needs to be off limits forever. By totally eliminating certain foods, you may actually increase cravings and decrease long-term success. Basing 90% of your diet on whole foods and eating smaller portions will allow you to enjoy treats occasionally yet still achieve excellent health. This is a far healthier approach than doing the opposite and eating 90% processed food and only 10% whole food like many people do. As the name suggests, supplements are meant to be used to a healthy diet. Including plenty of nutrient-dense foods in your diet should help you reverse deficiencies and meet all your daily needs. However, a few well-researched supplements have been shown to be helpful in some cases. One example is , which is naturally obtained from sunlight and foods like oily fish. Most people have low levels or are deficient ( ). Supplements like magnesium, zinc and can provide additional benefits if you do not get enough of them from your diet ( , , ). Other supplements can be used to enhance sports performance. , and beta-alanine all have plenty of research supporting their use ( , , ). In a perfect world, your diet would be full of nutrient-dense foods with no need for supplements. However, this isn't always achievable in the real world. If you are already making a constant effort to improve your diet, additional supplements can help take your health a step further. Nutrition isn't the only thing that matters for optimal health.

The good news is that you don't need to eat all of the amino acids at once. Your body can create complete proteins from the foods you eat throughout the day. While meat, fish, and eggs are good sources of essential amino acids, you can also get protein from plant sources like beans, soy, nuts, and some grains. Exactly how much protein you need daily depends on a variety of factors including how active you are, and your age.

Including healthy fats in your diet can help you to balance your blood sugar, decrease your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, and improve your brain function. They're also powerful anti-inflammatories, and they may lower your risk of arthritis, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. The most famous unsaturated fats are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Unsaturated fats are important for your body as they provide essential fatty acids your body can't make. You can find these healthy fats in nuts, seeds, fish, and vegetable oils (like olive, avocado, and flaxseed). Coconut oil provides plant-based fats in the form of medium-chain triglycerides which impart health benefits like faster utilization by organs as fuel and appetite control.

Vitamins are essential for healthy vision, skin, and bones. Vitamins may lower the risk of lung and prostate cancer, and they're powerful antioxidants. Vitamins like vitamin C boost the immune system and help the body heal.

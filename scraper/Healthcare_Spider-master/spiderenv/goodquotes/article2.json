{"blogTitle": "A Healthy Nighttime Routine for Type 2 Diabetes", "blogText": "<p class=\"eh-pg-headline__dek\">Managing type 2 diabetes requires following a healthy routine all day and at night. Here's what you should do in the evenings to wake up with better blood sugar control.</p> <p>If you have type 2 diabetes, you probably already know what you have to do during the day to stay healthy. But you may not pay as much attention to your nighttime routine. Forming good habits at night can be just as important for blood sugar control, says\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.eatrightpro.org/media/meet-our-spokespeople/spokespeople/sandra-arevalo\">Sandra J. Ar\u00e9valo, RD, CDE</a>,\u00a0the director of community and patient education for Montefiore Medical Center in New York and a spokesperson for the American Association of Diabetes Educators.</p> <p>As the sun sets, take these steps to ensure the next day is a good one for managing your diabetes.</p> <h2>Eat a nutritious dinner</h2> <p>A healthy <a href=\"//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/\">type 2 diabetes</a>\u00a0diet includes fruits and vegetables, lean meats, and plant-based sources of protein (such as beans), along with less processed foods and foods without added sugar, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA). But you may need to adjust your meal plan a bit for dinner, Ar\u00e9valo says.</p> <p>The later in the day you eat, the fewer carbs you should include in your meal, she says. If you eat too much sugar and carbohydrates at the end of the day, your morning blood sugar may be higher than it should be, she says. What you eat last sets up how you wake up the next day. Keep in mind that the number of carbohydrates you need to aim for at each meal may depend on your diabetes medicines or type of insulin. So check with your doctor, a registered dietitian, or a diabetes educator about your requirements.</p> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/type-1-diabetes/how-to-avoid-blood-sugar-pitfalls/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">How to Avoid Blood Sugar Pitfalls </a></h3> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/what-you-can-learn-about-type-2-diabetes-from-your-pancreas-liver-and-kidneys/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">What You Can Learn About Type 2 Diabetes From Your Pancreas, Liver, and Kidneys</a></h3> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">What Is Type 2 Diabetes? Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention</a></h3> <p>For most people, this means filling up on healthy foods that are lower in carbs, such as lean meats, fish, poultry, nuts, and oils. Pair this with non-starchy veggies such as broccoli, carrots, and dark leafy greens, a low-calorie and nutrient-dense diabetes superfood. When you choose carbs, Ar\u00e9valo recommends complex carbs, which contain fiber, so they take longer to break down into sugar. Some options are sweet potatoes, brown rice, beans, quinoa, or barley.</p> <h2>Get moving</h2> <p><a href=\"//www.everydayhealth.com/hs/type-2-diabetes-live-better-guide/strength-training-help-manage-diabetes/\">Exercising</a>\u00a0too close to bedtime can be stimulating, but you also don't want to just sit after dinner, Ar\u00e9valo says. Exercise helps increase your insulin sensitivity while decreasing your blood glucose levels - an effect that can last up to 24 hours.</p> <p>Go for a walk around the block or do some stretches during TV commercials. If you're active for about a half hour, it will help you bring your blood sugar back to normal and allow you to sleep better, because you'll be more tired, Ar\u00e9valo says.</p> <h2>Pack a healthy lunch for the next day</h2> <p>Ordering lunch at work or getting takeout can make it more difficult to make <a href=\"//www.everydayhealth.com/hs/type-2-diabetes-guide-healthy-habits/tips-eat-more-mindfully-pictures/\">healthy choices</a>, plus it's more expensive, Ar\u00e9valo says. The night before is the perfect time to pack a balanced meal that's low in calories and carbs. Then all you have to do in the morning is put it in your cooler or lunch bag and store it in the refrigerator at work, she says. Come lunchtime, it's ready and waiting for you.</p> <h2>Lay out your diabetes supplies for the morning</h2> <p>This is the same idea as packing a healthy lunch, Ar\u00e9valo says. It's easier if you plan ahead and make sure you have what you need, and the evening is a good time to make sure you're stocked before the morning rush the next day.</p> <p>Make it even simpler by planning ahead and getting all of your diabetes medications and supplies for the week ready on Sunday night. Pillboxes with designated days of the week can help you stay organized, so you'll know when you're running low and restock before you have an emergency, Ar\u00e9valo says.</p> <h3 class=\"horizontal-content-card__header\"><a class=\"cr-anchor\" href=\"\" target=\"\" title=\"\">6 Treat-Related Tricks for a Healthier Halloween</a></h3> <h2><strong>Bru</strong>sh and floss your teeth</h2> <p>Taking good care of your gums and teeth is critical if you have diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes are more prone to gum disease and cavities, according to the ADA. When you have type 2 diabetes, your saliva is a little sweeter than normal, Ar\u00e9valo explains. This can lead to a vicious cycle, where diabetes can contribute to gum (periodontal) disease, which in turn increases blood sugar levels, which makes it harder to control diabetes.</p> <p>Bacteria love sugar and could have a feast overnight, so be sure to brush and floss before bed to remove food and bacteria and keep your teeth and gums healthy, Ar\u00e9valo says.</p> <h2>Inspect your feet for injuries</h2> <p>When you have had diabetes for a long time, you can start to lose sensitivity in\u00a0<a href=\"//www.everydayhealth.com/hs/type-2-diabetes-guide-healthy-habits/caring-for-foot-wounds/\">your feet</a>\u00a0due to nerve damage, Ar\u00e9valo says. This means you may not know that you have cuts or blisters on your feet that can lead to potentially dangerous infections, according to the ADA. And high blood sugar levels plus poor circulation can make it harder for the body to fight off infection, which puts people with diabetes at greater risk of amputation.</p> <p>The good news: Proper foot care can greatly reduce your risk of infection. Take time each night to inspect your feet for cuts, cracks, ulcers, ingrown toenails, blisters, or other changes in your feet. Clean your feet with warm water and soap. Dry thoroughly, especially between the toes, and dress any wounds with protective bandages. Talk to your doctor about other steps you can take to keep your feet healthy.</p> <p>Since diabetes can also cause dry and itchy skin, which can be due to high blood sugar and poor circulation, you may also want to make moisturizing your feet part of your bedtime routine. Just don't put moisturizer between your toes, where it may not get absorbed, because excessive moisture can lead to infection.</p> <h2>Test your blood sugar</h2> <p>If you've been instructed to check your blood sugar at bedtime, don't forget. Setting your smartphone alarm as a reminder may be helpful. Talk to your doctor about whether you should\u00a0<a href=\"//www.everydayhealth.com/hs/managing-type-2-diabetes/need-know-blood-sugar-testing/\">test your blood sugar</a>\u00a0before bed and what your target range should be.</p> <p>You may or may not have to check your blood sugar level during the night, Ar\u00e9valo says. If your blood sugar is in range of what you and your doctor have determined is right for you, or if your A1C (your blood sugar over time) is normal, you may not have to, she says.</p> <h2>De-stress</h2> <p>Between checking your blood sugar levels, exercising, and planning your meals, managing type 2 diabetes can be stressful. And it's hard to take good care of yourself when you're stressed. It's important to manage stress and take care of your mental health, since stress can directly affect your blood sugar levels.</p> <p>At the end of the day, take time to de-stress. Give your body the time it needs to wind down and get into sleep mode in the hour before bedtime. Try breathing exercises or do something you find relaxing, such as reading a book or listening to music.</p> <p>Finally, keep in mind that depression can happen to anyone, making it difficult to keep up with self-care and diabetes management and increasing the risk of insomnia and other sleeping problems. Watch for signs of depression, including feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, changes in sleep patterns, withdrawal from friends, and changes in appetite, and talk to a doctor if you think you might be depressed.</p> <h2>Practice good sleep hygiene</h2> <p>Not getting enough quality sleep makes it so your body uses insulin less efficiently the next day. So prioritize getting a good night's sleep every night.</p> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/what-you-can-learn-about-type-2-diabetes-from-your-pancreas-liver-and-kidneys/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">What You Can Learn About Type 2 Diabetes From Your Pancreas, Liver, and Kidneys</a></h3> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/manage-blood-sugar-live-well-guide/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">How to Manage Blood Sugar and Take Charge of Type 2 Diabetes</a></h3> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">What Is Type 2 Diabetes?

{"blogTitle": "Heart Health Month: February 2020", "blogText": "<h2></h2> <p><strong>There are lots of ways to get involved in promoting heart disease awareness, research, and support both in February and throughout the year.</strong></p> <p>Heart disease is one of the most widespread and complicated health challenges, both in the United States and around the world. Cardiovascular disease - disorders of the heart and blood vessels - accounted for over 840,000 deaths in the United States in 2016, or about 1 in 3 deaths, <span><a href=\"https://professional.heart.org/idc/groups/ahamah-public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_503396.pdf\">according\u00a0to the American Heart Association</a></span><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Worldwide, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, accounting for over 17.6 million deaths in 2016 - a number that's expected to grow to over 23.6 million by 2030. About 80 percent of these deaths are due to\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"//www.everydayhealth.com/heart-disease/\">heart disease</a></span><span> and </span><span><a href=\"//www.everydayhealth.com/stroke/guide/\">stroke</a></span><span>, and mostly affect low- and middle-income countries,\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"https://www.world-heart-federation.org/world-heart-day/world-heart-day-2019/cvds/\">according to the World Heart Federation</a></span><span>.</span></p> <p><span>In the United States, over 120 million people had some form of cardiovascular disease between 2013 and 2016, and the total direct costs of heart disease and stroke were estimated to be over $200 billion between 2014 and 2015 - accounting for about 14 percent of all health costs, more than any other category of diseases. And these costs are projected to rise to nearly $750 billion by 2035.</span></p> <p><span>But despite these enormous challenges, there are some hopeful signs. Many </span><span><a href=\"//www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/living-with/emerging-heart-disease-risk-factors/\">risk factors for heart disease</a></span><span> can be modified, including lack of </span><span><a href=\"//www.everydayhealth.com/heart-disease/importance-exercising-heart-health/\">physical activity</a></span><span>, poor </span><span><a href=\"//www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/diet/new-year-new-you-sample-diet-healthy-heart/\">diet</a></span><span>, and tobacco use. And in the United States, the death rate from cardiovascular disease decreased by 18.6 percent between 2006 and 2016, according to an American Heart Association <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\">report\u00a0published in January 2019 in the journal <em>Circulation</em></a>.</span></p> <p><span>These facts - showing both the huge problem that heart disease presents, and the opportunities to reduce its burden - point to the importance of heart disease awareness and action. This year, a number of advocacy and research organizations are supporting events to help educate the public about cardiovascular disease, as well as raise money for research and support services.</span></p> <p><span>Here's an overview of events and activities related to heart health in February and beyond, and how you can get involved in your community and online.</span></p> <h2>Heart Health Awareness Days and Weeks</h2> <p><span>February is the awareness month for heart health in the United States, with one day set aside as National Wear Red Day to raise awareness of heart disease.

Thanks to its star main ingredient, banana bread offers a bounty of potential health perks.</p> <h2><strong>The Proven Health Benefits of Bananas</strong></h2> <p>A medium-size banana offers 422 milligrams (mg) of <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/potassium-defined-recommended-intake-sources-health-benefits-more/\">potassium</a>, or nearly 9 percent of the daily value (DV), according to the <a href=\"https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/341529/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</a>. Indulging in a fresh slice of the fruit-based dessert can help you get your fix of the mineral, which may help reduce blood pressure, according to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/potassium.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medline Plus</a>. Because high blood pressure is linked to a greater risk for heart disease, that's great news for your ticker.

According to the USDA, that same medium-size banana offers 3 grams (g) of <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/fiber-benefits-food-sources-supplements-side-effects/\">fiber</a>, a nutrient that can help you lose or maintain body weight. The fiber in bananas appears to come from resistant starch.

Fresh, homemade banana bread recipes offer proof that it's possible. To create the most nutritious loaf possible, you'll want to swap sugar for the naturally sweet fruit, and ditch <a href=\"https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/444977/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fatty butter</a> in favor of a healthy oil or other creative ingredients.</p> <p>For some sweet inspiration, peruse this list of 10 healthy banana bread recipes that are the perfect treat for this weekend (or any day, really).</p> <h2>Vegan Coconut Banana Bread With Walnut Streusel</h2> <p>If you're <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/vegan-diet-guide-benefits-risks-weight-loss-effect-food-list/\">vegan</a>, chances are you've come across more than a few appealing-sounding banana bread recipes online only to discover that eggs and butter appear in the ingredients list. Let go of that disappointment now by opting to make this animal-product-free version from <a href=\"https://emilykylenutrition.com/about-emily/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emily Kyle, RDN</a>, of Livonia, New York.

{"blogTitle": "Task Force Questions Value of Routine Screening for Cognitive Impairment", "blogText": "<p class=\"eh-pg-headline__dek\">In an updated report, the USPSTF concludes there is insufficient evidence to support screening asymptomatic older adults for cognitive impairment.</p> <p>For years, doctors have used a number of different testing tools to screen for cognitive impairment in older adults.</p> <p>Examples include the verbal fluency test, in which your doctor may, for example, ask you to list as many animals as you can in 60 seconds, or the Sweet 16 test, which quickly assesses several types of cognitive function.</p> <p>Now, however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a volunteer panel of national experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine, has called the value of these screening tools into question in a\u00a0<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761651?resultClick=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report published February 25 in the<em> Journal of the American Medical Association</em></a>. After reviewing published research from dozens of clinical studies, the USPSTF has indicated that evidence supporting the use of these tests is lacking - meaning: it's insufficient to properly assess the potential benefits and harms associated with them.</p> <h2><strong>Screening for Cognitive Impairment Given an \u2018I' for Insufficient Evidence</strong></h2> <p>They didn't give it a \u2018D' rating, which would be against the use of screening; they gave it an \u2018I' for insufficient evidence, notes <a href=\"https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/howard-m-fillit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Howard Fillit, MD</a>, the founding executive director and chief science officer for the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) and a geriatrician and neurologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City.</p> <p>The report is actually an update of a similar one issued by the USPSTF in 2014. Although it's unclear how many clinicians take these types of recommendations on board, the report could change how so-called <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/dementia/progression-pace-decline-varies/\">mild cognitive impairment</a> and <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/dementia/\">dementia</a> are diagnosed and treated - and its release isn't without controversy.</p> <p>Indeed, on the day the task force recommendations were released, the ADDF noted that even though the task force report does not imply people with memory or related cognitive problems should forego assessment, there is a risk that some will interpret the report's no evidence finding as negative evidence.</p> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms/thinking-memory-problems-ms/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">How to Manage Thinking and Memory Problems in MS</a></h3> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/longer-nfl-career-tied-depression-anxiety-cognitive-decline/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">Longer NFL Career Tied to Depression, Anxiety, and Cognitive Decline</a></h3> <h2><strong>Screening for Dementia Still Deemed Worthy</strong></h2> <p>In general, the USPSTF writes that there is insufficient evidence supporting the screening of asymptomatic, community-dwelling adults age 65 and older for cognitive impairment. Essentially, the group argues that more research is needed.</p> <p>In addition, although the task force acknowledges that there is adequate evidence that some screening tools can be used effectively to <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/dementia/guide/diagnosis/\">detect dementia</a> in roughly one out of five adults between ages 65 and 74, and up to 50 percent of adults age 85 and older, their ability to spot mild cognitive impairment, which is far more common, is less well proved.</p> <p>Furthermore, the USPSTF says, even if cognitive impairment is diagnosed earlier through the use of these tests, the research evidence to date suggests that many medications the doctors would prescribe on the basis of the results - including drugs like <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/namenda\">Namenda (memantine)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/alzheimers-disease/guide/treatment/\">acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</a> - would have only a small effect in preserving cognitive function.</p> <p>Evidence supporting the use of nonpharmacologic treatments like certain vitamins and dietary supplements is also inadequate, the task force adds.</p> <h2><strong>Some Experts Disagree, Saying There's Greater Harm in Doing Nothing</strong></h2> <p>I've been taking care of people with dementia for 40 years, Dr. Fillit notes. When I see a statement like this that effectively says, \u2018There's nothing I can do,' well, what have I been doing with my patients? The danger is that this recommendation can easily lead to an attitude of nihilism toward early diagnosis, care, and treatment of older people with cognitive impairment.</p> <p>In a commentary published in conjunction with the task force recommendations, <a href=\"https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/petersen-ronald-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-00078363\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ronald C.

A negative interpretation of the value of cognitive screening in the primary care setting would ignore the potential value to patients and families of the knowledge of the patient's cognitive function.</p> <p>In other words, as Fillit argues, even if screening effectively identifies only 20 percent of adults with cognitive impairment, and gets them on treatment designed to help slow their decline, isn't that better than getting none of these people the care that could help them?</p> <p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/my-health-story/day-life-with-mild-cognitive-impairment/\">A Day in the Life With Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Others Say Risk Reduction Is Possible With or Without Testing</strong></h2> <p>In another commentary published with the USPSTF report, <a href=\"https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/phab/phab-senior-academic-staff/professor-carol-brayne-cbe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carol Brayne, MD</a>, a professor of public health medicine at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, writes that, <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/health-answers/ways-prevent-dementia/\">risk reduction for cognitive impairment</a> includes stopping smoking and moderating alcohol intake; promoting healthful diet and physical activity; and preventing and managing hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and depression.

{"blogTitle": "How to Tweak Your Skin-Care Routine for Spring, Depending on Your Skin Type", "blogText": "<p class=\"eh-pg-headline__dek\">Get rid of dull winter skin by exfoliating and moisturizing, then step into the season with a lighter cleanser and moisturizer, and more.</p> <p>When the first signs of spring emerge, it's like a breath of fresh air - and your skin loves it, too. With the change from winter to spring, our skin is exposed less to cold, dry air and more to higher moisture levels in the air, warmer temperatures, and increased sunshine, says <a href=\"https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/blair-murphy-md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blair Murphy-Rose, MD</a>, a board-certified dermatologist at Medical Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery in New York City and assistant faculty at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.</p> <p>You can look at changing your spring skin-care routine in a couple of ways: First, reevaluate your relationship with the products you should be using year-round, such as <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/sunscreen-glossary-decoding-every-spf-term-you-need-know/\">sunscreen</a>, then pivot how you use other products to accommodate for warmer weather, says <a href=\"https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/michele-farber-md/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michelle Farber, MD</a>, a board-certified dermatologist with the Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City. Because of rising humidity and extra sweat, you'll change the way you'll <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/adult-acne/acne-treatments/\">treat acne</a>, signs of aging, or both, she says.</p> <p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/beauty-pictures/everything-you-didnt-know-about-washing-your-face.aspx\"><strong>8 Simple Rules for Washing Your Face</strong></a></p> <p>Now that you know you'll be switching things up, you'll want to know how. Here are seven tweaks to consider for glowing and gorgeous skin all spring, depending on your skin type or concern.</p> <h2><strong>If You Have Dry Skin, Get Your Glow Back With a Weekly Hydrating Mask</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/how-to-tweak-your-skin-care-routine-for-winter-depending-on-your-skin-type/\">Winter has a way of stealing your natural glow</a>, and it's time to reintroduce yourself to a more vibrant skin tone come spring. To get rid of dry, dull, and sometimes flaky skin, I recommend a combination of moisturization and exfoliation, says Dr. Murphy-Rose. A gentle hydrating mask once or twice a week will infuse skin with the moisture it needs to recover from parching winter winds. She likes SkinCeuticals Hydrating B5 Mask ($55, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Hydrating+B5+Masque_10908.htm\">Dermstore.com</a>), a gel-based mask with <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/hyaluronic-acid-definition-benefits-and-the-best-serums/\">hyaluronic acid</a> (which helps absorb moisture from the environment) and vitamin B5 (to support skin repair).</p> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/wellness-bloggers-tips-protect-skin-from-sun-damage/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">7 Wellness Bloggers' Tips to Protect Skin From Sun Damage</a></h3> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/beauty-pictures/7-surprising-causes-of-dry-skin.aspx\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">10 Surprising Causes of Dry Skin</a></h3> <h2><strong>If You Have Dull Skin, Slough Off Dead Cells With an Exfoliating Cleanser</strong></h2> <p>As Murphy-Rose mentioned, <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/a-detailed-guide-on-how-to-exfoliate-your-skin/\">exfoliation</a> is critical for removing the layer of dead skin cells that makes skin appear sallow and feel flaky. Exfoliation will bring a fresh layer of skin to the surface. Your complexion will be brighter, and there's the added benefit that your skin-care products will be more readily absorbed, and thus will work better, she says. Gentle chemical-based exfoliants are less likely to cause irritation compared with harsh scrubs. If you've been using a creamy cleanser, switch to a cleanser with alpha- or beta-hydroxy acids, such as Glytone Mild Cream Cleanser ($33,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Mild+Cream+Cleanser_359.htm\">Dermstore.com</a>). Look for glycolic or lactic acid; those with salicylic acid are best for acne-prone complexions.</p> <p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/a-comprehensive-guide-to-using-acids-in-your-skin-care-routine/\"><strong>A Comprehensive Guide to Using Acids in Your Skin-Care Routine</strong></a></p> <h2><strong>If You Have Acne-Prone Skin, Switch to a Lighter-Weight Moisturizer </strong></h2> <p>In winter, your skin needs all the help it can get when it comes to hydration. Now for spring, you may be emerging from hibernation and spending more time outdoors, which means you're probably sweating more, says Dr. Farber. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you'll want to consider making the change to a <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/the-benefits-of-using-a-water-based-gel-moisturizer/\">gel-based moisturizer</a>, which is generally lighter weight and less likely to plug pores than those formulated with oil. Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel ($28, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sephora.com/product/dramatically-different-moisturizing-gel-P122900\">Sephora.com</a>) is one option.</p> <p>On the other hand, if you have sensitive skin, you might want to keep using a thicker, richer cream to more readily lock in moisture and preserve skin's protective barrier. If yours is the type that is both sensitive and acne-prone, look for moisturizers that are oil-free or noncomedogenic, which means it won't plug up pores. One example: Neutrogena Oil-Free Facial Moisturizer ($9.39, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Moisturizer-Ultra-Gentle-Lightweight-Moisturizers/dp/B000052YOX\">Amazon.com</a>).</p> <h3 class=\"horizontal-content-card__header\"><a class=\"cr-anchor\" href=\"\" target=\"\" title=\"\">6 Ways to Reduce Fine Lines and Wrinkles Without Getting Botox </a></h3> <p>Make these modifications based on how your skin is feeling. Also remember that early and late spring can be very different from each other in terms of weather, so you may need to make adjustments based on the temperature changes in your area, she says.</p> <h2><strong>If You Have Aging Skin, Ramp Up Your Retinoid Usage</strong></h2> <p>Retinoids, which are\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/vitamin-a\">vitamin A</a> derivatives, are the mainstay of a healthy skin-care routine because they increase cellular turnover on skin to make your complexion appear brighter and fresher and, according to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30674002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a review published in June 2019 in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Dermatology</em></a>, keep pores clear to treat acne. Retinoids also bolster collagen production to help smooth lines and wrinkles, per <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-retinoids-really-reduce-wrinkles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard Health</a>. That said, they have the unfortunate effect of causing unpleasant side effects in some people, namely dryness or flakiness, as your skin gets used to the increased cellular turnover. Because of that, you may have found that your skin was generally too dry in winter to handle a retinoid or you could use it only once a week or so.</p> <p>Now that spring is here, though, it's time to consider using a retinoid or retinol (a weaker form of retinoid) more often, says <a href=\"https://www.mudgildermatology.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adarsh Vijay Mudgil, MD</a>, of Mudgil Dermatology in New York City. Warmer weather months allow skin to tolerate more frequent application, and the more you can use a retinoid, the more benefits - to skin cell turnover, <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/collagen-health-benefits-food-sources-supplements-types-more/\">collagen</a> stimulation, reduced pore size - you'll get, he says. Continue to ramp up slowly. For example, if you've been using it twice a week, go to three, then reevaluate how your skin responds. The goal is to get to daily use, or as close to daily as possible without experiencing side effects, he says. Applying a moisturizer over your retinoid will help combat dryness and flakiness, adds Farber.</p> <p>Retinoids are prescribed by your dermatologist. You can also use a retinol, a generally weaker version of a retinoid; they are available over-the-counter. This can be a good option if you're new to this family of active ingredients, as retinols generally cause fewer side effects.</p> <p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/burning-questions-about-retinol-answered/\"><strong>15 Burning Questions About Retinol, Answered</strong></a></p> <h2><strong>If You Have Rosacea, Calm Post-Winter Skin</strong></h2> <p>Many people find that cold winter winds trigger redness and irritation if they're managing <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/rosacea/\">rosacea</a>, says Murphy-Rose. She recommends calming skin for spring by using moisturizers that contain anti-inflammatory ingredients, like niacinamide, <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/aloe-vera-benefits-risks-uses-more/\">aloe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/vitamin-c/\">vitamin C</a>, or cucumber.

That said, you still may want to look the part. For a glow without the sun damage, Murphy-Rose recommends applying a DHA self-tanner. These lotions contain the ingredient dihydroxyacetone (DHA), an additive that reacts with the cells in skin's outer layer to temporarily darken your color, according to the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sunless-tanning/art-20046803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mayo Clinic</a>. They won't protect you from the sun (you still need that SPF), but they are safe to use. Try St. Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzing Mousse ($32, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sephora.com/product/self-tan-classic-bronzing-mousse-P407450\">Sephora.com</a>), a well-reviewed product with DHA.</p> <p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/sun-care-products-dermatologists-love/\">10 Sun-Care Products That Dermatologists Use </a></strong></p> <h2><strong>No Matter Your Skin Concern, Continue to Wear Sunscreen Every Day</strong></h2> <p>Dermatologists will tell you to wear sunscreen on exposed areas of skin every day, no matter the temperature or weather. The reality is, they know you don't always abide by that rule. If you live in a northern climate and were bundled up for winter and rarely outside, you may have gotten out of the habit of wearing sunscreen. Spring is the time to get a new bottle and start using it again. In the spring, people are outdoors more, but the weather isn't summer-hot yet, so people discount how strong the sun is and don't protect themselves sufficiently, says Murphy-Rose. Therefore, your risk of sun damage may be even higher in the spring, she says.</p> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/best-moisturizers-soothing-dry-winter-skin/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">7 Moisturizers Dermatologists Recommend for Soothing Dry Winter Skin</a></h3> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/wellness-bloggers-tips-protect-skin-from-sun-damage/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">7 Wellness Bloggers' Tips to Protect Skin From Sun Damage</a></h3> <p>To <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/steps-choosing-clean-safe-sunscreen/\">choose the most effective sunscreen</a>, go for an SPF 30 and look for one considered a physical sunscreen, which contains titanium or zinc oxide, suggests Dr. Mudgil. Active ingredients in physical sunscreens physically block UV rays, as opposed to chemical sunscreens, which absorb these rays, according to the <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/sun-protection/sunscreen-patients/sunscreen-faqs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Academy of Dermatology</a>.

{"blogTitle": "Heart Health: How to Avoid Overeating During the Holidays", "blogText": "<p class=\"eh-pg-headline__dek\">It's that wonderful time of year when comfort foods flood our fridges, break rooms, and dinner tables. But for people at risk of heart disease, holiday binge eating can have serious consequences. Find out how to curb those impulses.</p> <p>The holiday dinner table may be decked with delicious foods, but to give your heart a gift, be sure to pace yourself this season. Overeating can cause <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/gerd/heartburn-causes-symptoms-diagnosis/\">heartburn</a> in the short term, and over time it can lead to unhealthy weight gain and obesity - which, according to the <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/losing-weight/extreme-obesity-and-what-you-can-do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Heart Association</a>, are two major risk factors for <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-attack/guide/\">heart attacks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-disease/\">heart disease</a>.</p> <p>In fact, a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27220854\" target=\"_blank\">study published in October 2016 in\u00a0<em>Clinical Research in Cardiology</em></a> revealed a holiday season peak in cardiac-related hospital admissions, with overeating cited as a key trigger.</p> <p>Binge eating puts stress on the body, explains\u00a0<a href=\"https://manhattancardiology.com/our-team/amnon-beniaminovitz-md-facc-fase-cbnc-rpvi/\" target=\"_blank\">Amnon Beniaminovitz, MD</a>, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in New York City. Much like emotional outbursts, running fast, or <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-attack/living-with/heres-how-cold-weather-can-trigger-heart-attack/\">shoveling snow</a>, overeating makes extra work for the heart, Dr. Beniaminovitz says.</p> <p>A large meal can also trigger the\u00a0release of norepinephrine, a stress hormone that can raise blood pressure and heart rate, say the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/diet-weight-loss/article/can-one-big-meal-kill-you\" target=\"_blank\">experts at University of California Berkeley Wellness</a>.</p> <p>They also note that a large meal, especially one full of fat and refined carbs, can raise the levels of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/high-cholesterol/guide/triglycerides/\">triglycerides</a> - a type of fat found in blood - putting you at an increased risk of stroke, heart attack, and heart disease.</p> <h2>The Long-Term Consequences of Overeating<strong> </strong></h2> <p><strong></strong><a href=\"https://www.columbiadoctors.org/sonia-tolani-md\" target=\"_blank\">Sonia Tolani, MD</a>,\u00a0an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City and part of Columbia's\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.columbiacardiology.org/our-services/womens-heart-service\" target=\"_blank\">Women's Heart Center</a><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">,</span> adds that when overeating results in being overweight, that in turn can lead to the onset of <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/\">type 2 diabetes</a>.

Stick to a Routine</h3> <p>Beniaminovitz believes having a strict diet and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-disease/importance-exercising-heart-health/\">exercise regimen</a> - eating the same meals at the same time each day, and not deviating too much from that routine - is the best way to avoid holiday gluttony. It's also a great tip for maintaining a heart-healthy diet all year round.</p> <h3>2. Avoid Foods With Saturated Fat</h3> <p>High-fat foods\u00a0and foods <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/daily-consumption-of-dairy-products-can-lower-risk-of-diabetes/\">rich in dairy</a> should also be avoided, recommends Dr. Tolani. Try opting for <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/diet/new-year-new-you-sample-diet-healthy-heart/\">heart-healthy foods</a> like lean proteins, lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, and <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/fiber-benefits-food-sources-supplements-side-effects/#healthbenefits\">high-fiber</a> whole grains.</p> <h3>3. Use Tech</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/best-weight-loss-apps-every-need/\">Calorie counting apps</a>, food trackers, and <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/heart-health-apps-download-now/\">heart-health monitoring apps</a> can be helpful year round as a digital accountability partner, suggests Tolani.</p> <h3><strong>4. Take Your Time</strong></h3> <p><strong></strong>It takes about 20 minutes for the brain to get the message that your stomach is full, says Everyday Health's staff nutritionist <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/authors/kelly-kennedy/\">Kelly Kennedy, RD</a>. If you keep eating during this time, you can eat a lot more than your body really needs. Slow down, chew your food well, and put your fork down between bites to prevent overeating. Tolani suggests that drinking water in between bites can help you pace yourself, too.<br></p> <h3>5. Plan Ahead</h3> <p>Have a plan before you arrive at a holiday gathering, advises Kennedy. She notes this could involve eating a healthy snack right before you arrive, drinking lots of water during the day, or planning to have a small portion of your favorite holiday treat. The key, she says, is to know what works for you and stick to it.</p> <h3 class=\"horizontal-content-card__header\"><a class=\"cr-anchor\" href=\"\" target=\"\" title=\"\">5 Reasons You Gained Weight This Fall</a></h3> <h3>6. Focus on the Company</h3> <p>It's easy to get swept up in all of the food at a holiday event, says Kennedy. Instead of making food the center of your day, focus on visiting with friends and family. Take time to make conversation between bites and you'll eat less and enjoy your visit more. When the holiday season draws to a close for another year, you're more likely to remember the time spent with loved ones than the meals themselves.<br></p>", "source": ["Everydayhealth.com"], "keyword": ["daily health fooding routine"], "link": ["https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/diet/heart-health-how-avoid-overeating-during-holidays/"]},

According to Dr. Elliott, there are three reasons medical professionals should make use of virtual care; to minimize sick patients' contact with others, to give mildly ill patients who don't need hospitalization recommendations for symptomatic relief, and to enable people with chronic conditions to still have access to care.</p> <p>Telemedicine is also an approach to reduce person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV2 through reducing person-to-person direct contact, says\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.bcm.edu/people/view/jill-weatherhead-md-ms-dtm-amp-h-faap/b27b082f-ffed-11e2-be68-080027880ca6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jill E.

This could also potentially reduce the rate of transmission within the community. But this practice should be used only if patients have mild SARS-CoV2 symptoms or are in need of non-SARS-CoV2-related and non-emergent medical care, such as refills on daily prescriptions or to discuss lab tests, she says.</p> <p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0</strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/scientists-fast-track-research-for-coronavirus-treatment-and-vaccine/\">Scientists Fast-Track Research for Coronavirus Treatment and Vaccine</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>2. </strong><strong>I Am Working From Home More</strong></h2> <p>Working from home may aid in reducing the rate of community transmission of SARS-CoV2. If more people are at home it reduces potential interactions with sick individuals. According to experts, this is also why it is imperative for individuals who are sick to stay at home.</p> <p>We determine the contagiousness of a virus by the reproductive number known as R0 (R-naught). This refers to how many people one single infected individual can transmit the virus to within the community, explains Weatherhead.</p> <p>According to Weatherhead, the estimated R0, or how quickly SARS-CoV2 can spread in a community is between 2-4, meaning one sick individual can spread the virus to 2 to 4 other people. As a result of rapid spread, health systems can be overwhelmed with the volume of patients infected.</p> <p>\"When social distancing is practiced, including telecommuting, the rate of transmission will be reduced, allowing hospital systems to better handle the pandemic [and] flatten the curve, explains Weatherhead.</p> <p><strong>RELATED: </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/pregnancy-and-coronavirus-what-are-the-risks/\">Pregnancy and Coronavirus: What Are the Risks?</a></strong></p> <h3 class=\"horizontal-content-card__header\"><a class=\"cr-anchor\" href=\"\" target=\"\" title=\"\">7 Ways Lady Gaga Practices Self-Care</a></h3> <h2><strong>3. </strong><strong>I Am Stocking Up on Medications and OTC Medicines</strong></h2> <p>It's essential for individuals to have their normal daily medical supplies available at home, particularly their medications, says Weatherhead. This is important in case they develop symptoms and need to be quarantined at home for 14 days.</p> <p>For people with chronic conditions, it's very important to make sure they get a minimum of a three-month supply of prescription medications, says Elliott. Keeping chronic conditions under control is very important, because people with them are at the highest risk for the COVID-19 disease.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CDC recommends</a> considering mail-order services for medications, if you need to stay home for a prolonged period of time.</p> <p>Elliott also recommends keeping open communication with your doctor: telemedicine, email and patient portals are all good options during this time when we are practicing social distancing.</p> <p><strong>RELATED: </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/coronavirus-and-prescription-medications-should-you-stock-up/\">Coronavirus and Prescription Medications: Should You Stock Up?</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>4. </strong><strong>I Am Buying Medical Supplies I Wouldn't Normally Purchase</strong></h2> <p>A common survey response: People are buying medical supplies that they normally wouldn't purchase. The two most popular? Thermometers and face masks.</p> <p>According to Weatherhead, face masks play a role for individuals who are infected who need to seek medical assistance and for caregivers of people who have become infected so they can protect themselves. It is not currently recommended for noninfected persons to wear a mask, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to the CDC</a>. Preserving access to masks for those who need them the most is critical for their health, she says.</p> <p>Experts generally recommend keeping thermometers on hand to take your temperature if you feel feverish, a common symptom of COVID-19.</p> <p>For people with chronic conditions, I recommend having a blood pressure cuff at home, ideally one with Bluetooth so you can upload the information easily to your doctor, says Elliott. She says inexpensive blood pressure cuffs work fine, too.</p> <p>People with lung conditions may want to consider home digital stethoscopes that can listen to the <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-disease/\">heart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/lung-respiratory/\">lungs</a> and send information to your doctor.

These things include what we call social distancing, [which means] avoiding contact with sick individuals [and] trying to stay six feet away from somebody who's coughing or might be sick, says <a href=\"https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1720019920/mark-j-mulligan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mark Mulligan, MD,</a> the director of the division of infectious diseases and immunology at NYU Langone Health and the director of the NYU Langone Vaccine Center.</p> <p>Don't feel shy on public transportation, for example, about moving away from somebody who's coughing, says Dr. Mulligan. He also recommends not going to work if you're sick. Stay home until at least 24 hours after a fever. For elderly individuals, avoid unnecessary visits and interactions, he says.</p> <p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/expert-tips-on-the-coronavirus-crisis-be-prepared-dont-panic/\"><strong>Expert Tips on the Coronavirus Crisis: Be Prepared, Don't Panic</strong></a></p> <h2><strong>How to Cope With Stress During a Pandemic\u00a0</strong></h2> <p>Our survey results included responses related to stress, like avoiding too much news, staying home and watching Netflix, and other activities to quell\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/anxiety/guide/\">anxiety</a>.</p> <p>We're seeing people engaging in things that give them illusory control, like panic buying and compulsively checking the news as a reassurance, says <a href=\"https://www.drvailewright.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vaile Wright, PhD,</a>\u00a0the director of clinical research and policy at the American Psychological Association. The level of uncertainty around the coronavirus brings a sense of threat or danger, which exacerbates people's anxiety and stress, because the uncertainty reminds people of all the things out of their control, Dr. Wright explains.</p> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/coronavirus/expert-tips-for-coping-with-covid-19-at-home/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">Expert Tips for Coping With COVID-19 at Home</a></h3> <h3 class=\"text-promo__title text-promo__multiple\"><a class=\"cr-anchor text-promo__text\" href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/preparing-for-coronavirus/\" target=\"\" title=\"\" rel=\" noopener noreferrer\">Preparing for Coronavirus</a></h3> <p>Her advice is to identify activities you do have control over. She said it's good to stay aware of things like places closing in your neighborhood because of the coronavirus but otherwise limit the news you're taking in, especially if you're looking at the same headlines over and over again. Identify reliable sources like WHO and the CDC and your local government; she recommended avoiding platforms like Twitter and Facebook for news updates.</p> <p>We see people - they can't stop themselves from scrolling. They're not posting about how many recoveries there have been but the number of deaths and the spread of the disease, Wright explains. These are important to know but it's not good to be overly saturated with them, she notes.</p> <p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/tips-on-how-to-handle-anxiety-in-the-time-of-covid-19/\"><strong>How to Handle Anxiety in the Time of COVID-19</strong></a></p> <p>According to Wright, it's important to think about <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/preparing-for-coronavirus/\">preparation measures for school closures</a>, teleworking, and coming up with contingency plans like buying supplies for a week or two. While people need to be doing important basic things that are good for them and their communities, they also need to pivot and think about their mental health and self-care routines: <br></p> <ul><li>Get enough sleep.</li><li>Eat well.</li><li>Stay active.</li><li>Reach out to friends and family virtually.</li><li>Find things you enjoy.</li></ul> <p>Wright calls these opposite actions, when you purposely do something to counter what's going on around you. She specifically advises against watching films and shows about pandemics (no matter what Netflix says is trending) because that's similar to panic buying - it lends a false sense of control. Instead she recommends choosing a comedy to watch, putting on some music, reading a comforting book or taking a bath - even if it's just for 10 minutes.</p> <h3 class=\"horizontal-content-card__header\"><a class=\"cr-anchor\" href=\"\" target=\"\" title=\"\">Reiki for Weight Loss: Does It Actually Work?</a></h3> <p>Try to focus on things within your control and accept that things are uncertain now but they will get better, she says.
